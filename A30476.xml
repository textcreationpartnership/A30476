            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Reverend Author's Reflexions upon <hi>Varilla</hi>'s his Hiſtory of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, having met with the Reception owing to the merit of all his Productions, has made me ſenſible, that I can never mount to a higher ſtrain of obliging the Publick, than in Continuing to entertain it with the Maſterly pieces of the ſame hand; this Conſideration induc'd me to go to Work upon theſe his incomparable <hi>Travelling Remarks,</hi> and having in this, as well as I had in the <hi>Reflexions,</hi> the advantage of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman to Correct and Over-ſee the Preſs, this

               </opener>
               <p>IT is ſo common to write Travels, that for one who has ſeen ſo little, and as it were in haſte, it may look like a preſumptuous Affectation to be reckoned among Voyagers, if he attempts to ſay any thing upon ſo ſhort a Ramble, and concerning Places ſo much viſited, and by conſequence ſo well
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60829:4"/> known: Yet having had opportunities that do not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelves to all that travel, and having joyned to thoſe a curioſity almoſt equal to the advantages I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, I fancy it will not be an ungrateful Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if I give you ſome account of thoſe things that pleaſed me moſt in the Places through which I have paſſed: but I will avoid ſaying ſuch things as occurr in ordinary Books, for which I refer you to the Prints; for as you know that I have no great inclination to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py what others have ſaid; ſo a Traveller has not lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure nor humour enough for ſo dull an Employment.</p>
               <p>As I came all the way from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Lyons,</hi> I was amazed to ſee ſo much miſery as appeared, not only in Villages, but even in big Towns, where all the marks of an extream Poverty, ſhewed them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>elves both in the Buildings, the Cloaths, and almoſt in the Looks of the Inhabitants. And a general diſ-peopling in all the Towns, was a very viſible effect of the hardſhips under which they lay.</p>
               <p>I need tell you nothing of the irregular and yet mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Situation of <hi>Lyons,</hi> of the noble Rivers that meet there, of the Rock cut from ſo vaſt a height for a Priſon, of the <hi>Carthuſians</hi> Gardens, of the Town-Houſe, of the Jeſuits Colledge and Library, of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Nunnery of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> of the Churches, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly St. <hi>Irenees,</hi> of the Remnants of the <hi>Aqueducts,</hi> of the Columns and the old Moſaick in the Abbey Dean: in ſhort, Mr. <hi>Spon</hi> has given ſuch an account of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities there, that it were a very preſumptuous At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to offer to come after him.</p>
               <p>The Speech of <hi>Claudius</hi> ingraven on a Plate of Braſs, and ſet in the end of the low Walk in the Town-houſe, is one of the nobleſt Antiquities in the World; by which we ſee the way of Writing and Pointing in that Age very copiouſly. The Shield of Silver of twenty two pound weight, in which ſome Remains of gilding do yet appear, and that ſeems to repreſent that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Action of <hi>Scipio</hi>'s, of reſtoring a fair Captive to a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60829:4"/> 
                  <hi>Celtiberian</hi> Prince, is certainly the nobleſt piece of Plate that is now extant: the emboſſing of it is ſo fine and ſo entire, that it is indeed unvaluable; and if there were an Inſcription upon it to put us beyond conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, it were yet much more ineſtimable.</p>
               <p>A great many Inſcriptions are to be ſeen of the late and barbarous Ages, as <hi>Bonum Memorium,</hi> and <hi>Epita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phium hunc.</hi> There are twenty three Inſcriptions in the Garden of the Fathers of <hi>Mercy,</hi> but ſo placed as it ſhews how little thoſe who poſſeſs them do either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand or value them. I ſhall only give you one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I made a little Reflection on it, tho' it is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps too well grounded, becauſe none of the Criticks have thought on it.</p>
               <p>The Inſcription is this, <hi>D. M. Et Memoriae AEternae Sutiae Anthidis. Quae vixit Annis XXV. M. XI. DV. Quae dum Nimia pia fuit, facta est Impia: &amp; Attio Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batiolo, Cecalius Caliſtio Conjux &amp; Pater, &amp; ſibi vivo ponendum curavit &amp; ſub aſcia dedicavit.</hi> This muſt be towards the barbarous Age, as appears by the falſe La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin in <hi>Nimia:</hi> But the Inſcription ſeems ſo extravagant, that a man dedicating a Burial-ſtone for his Wife and Son, and under which himſelf was to be laid, with Ceremonies of Religion, ſhould tax his Wife of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, and give ſo extraordinary an account of her becoming ſo through an exceſs of Piety, that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves ſome conſideration.</p>
               <p>It ſeems the Impiety was publick, otherwiſe a Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band would not have recorded it in ſuch a manner; and it is plain that he thought it roſe from an exceſs of Piety.</p>
               <p>I need not examine the Conjectures of others; but will chuſe rather to give you my own, and ſubmit it to your cenſure.</p>
               <p>It ſeems to me, that this <hi>Sutia Anthis</hi> was a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; for the Chriſtians, becauſe they would not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Gods of the Heathens, nor participate with them in their ſacred Rites, were accuſed both of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60829:5"/> Atheiſm and Impiety. This is ſo often objected, and the Fathers in their Apologies have anſwered it ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that it were loſt labour to prove it: ſo this Wife of <hi>Cerealius Caliſtio</hi> having turned Chriſtian, it ſeems he thought he was bound to take ſome notice of it in the Inſcription. But by it he gives a honourable Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Chriſtian Doctrine at the ſame time that he ſeems to accuſe it; that through an exceſs of Piety his Wiſe was carried to it; ſince a mind ſeriouſly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with a true ſenſe of Piety could not avoid the falling under a diſtaſte of Paganiſm, and the becoming Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Grenoble</hi> there is not much to be ſeen. The learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mr. <hi>Chorier</hi> has ſome Manuſcripts of conſiderable Antiquity. In one of <hi>Vegetius de re Militari,</hi> there is a clear correction of a Paſſage that in all the printed Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is not ſenſe. In the Chapter of the ſize of the Souldiers, he begins; <hi>Scio ſemper menſuram à Mario Conſule exactam: à</hi> is in no <hi>MS.</hi> and <hi>Mario Conſule</hi> is a miſtake for <hi>trium Cubitorum,</hi> for III which are for <hi>trium</hi> have been read <hi>M.</hi> and <hi>C,</hi> which ſtands for <hi>Cubitorum,</hi> as appears by all that follows, was by a miſtake read <hi>Conſule;</hi> ſo the true reading of that Paſſage, is, <hi>Scio menſuram trium Cubitorum fuiſſe ſemper exactam.</hi> He ſhewed me another <hi>MS.</hi> of about five or ſix hundred years old, in which St. <hi>John</hi>'s Revelation is contained, all exemplified in Figures; and after that came <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s Fables, likewiſe all deſigned in Figures: from which he inferred, that thoſe who deſigned thoſe two Books valued both equally, and ſo put them together.</p>
               <p>I will not deſcribe the Valley of <hi>Dauphine,</hi> all to <hi>Chambery,</hi> nor entertain you with a Landskip of the Country, which deſerves a better Pencil than mine, and in which the heighth and rudeneſs of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that almoſt ſhut upon it, together with the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the evenneſs, and fruitfulneſs of the Valley, that is all along well watered with the River of <hi>Liſerre,</hi> make ſuch an agreeable mixture, that this vaſt diverſity of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60829:5"/> Objects that do at once fill the Eye, gives it a very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining Proſpect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chambery</hi> has nothing in it that deſerves a long De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription; and <hi>Geneva</hi> is too well known to be much inſiſted on. It is a little State, but it has ſo many good Conſtitutions in it, that the greateſt may juſtly learn at it. The Chamber of the Corn has always two years Proviſion for the City in ſtore, and forces none but the Bakers to buy of it at a taxed price; and ſo it is both neceſſary for any Extremities under which the State may fall, and is likewiſe of great advantage; for it gives a good yearly Income, that has helpt the State to pay near a Million of Debt contracted during the Wars; and the Citizens are not oppreſſed by it; for every Inhabitant may buy his own Corn as he pleaſes, only Publick Houſes muſt buy from the Chamber. And if one will compare the faith of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Geneva</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by this particular, he will be enforced to prefer the latter; for if good Works are a ſtrong preſumption, if not a ſure Indication of a good Faith, then Juſtice being a good Work of the firſt form, <hi>Geneva</hi> will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly carry it.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Rome,</hi> the Pope buys in all the Corn of the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; for none of the Landlords can ſell it either to Merchants or Bakers. He buys it at five Crowns their Meaſure, and even that is ſlowly and ill paid; ſo that there was eight hundred thouſand Crowns owing upon that ſcore when I was at <hi>Rome.</hi> In ſelling this out, the Meaſure is leſſened a fifth part, and the price of the whole is doubled; ſo that what was bought at five Crowns, is ſold out at twelve: and if the Bakers, who are obliged to take a determined quantity of Corn from the Chamber, cannot retail out all that is impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon them, but are forced to return ſome part of it back, the Chamber diſcounts to them only the firſt price of five Crowns: whereas in <hi>Geneva</hi> the meaſure by which they buy and ſell is the ſame; and the Gain is ſo inconſiderable, that it is very little beyond the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60829:6"/> common Market price: ſo that upon the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Chamber of the Corn is but the Merchant to the State. But if the Publick makes a moderate Gain by the Corn, that and all the other Revenues of this ſmall Commonwealth are ſo well employed, that there is no cauſe of complaint given in the Adminiſtration of the publick Purſe; which with the advanta es that ariſe out of the Chamber of the Corn, is about one hundred thouſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But there is much to go out of this: Three hundred Souldiers are payed; an Arſenal is maintained, that in proportion to the State is the greateſt in the World; for it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Arms for more men than are in the State: there is a great number of Miniſters and Profeſſors, in all twenty four, payed out of it, beſides all the publick Charges and Offices of the Government. Every one of the leſſer Council of twenty five, having a hundred Crowns, and every <hi>Syndic</hi> having two hundred Crowns Penſion: and after all this come the accidental Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Deputies, that they are obliged to ſend often to <hi>Paris,</hi> to <hi>Savoy,</hi> and to <hi>Zwitzerland;</hi> ſo that it is very apparent, no man can enrich himſelf at the Coſt of the Publick. And the appointments of the little Council are a very ſmall recompence for the great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance that they are obliged to give the Publick, which is commonly four or five hours a day. The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary for the Profeſſors and Miniſters is indeed ſmall, not above two hundred Crowns; but to ballance this, which was a more competent Proviſion when it was firſt ſet off a hundred and fifty years ago, the price of all things, and the way of living, being now much heightned, thoſe Employments are here held in their due Reputation, and the richeſt Citizens in the Town breed up their Children ſo as to qualifie them for thoſe Places: And a Miniſter that is ſutable to his Character, is thought ſo good a Match, that generally they have ſuch Eſtates, either by Succeſſion or Marriage, as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them ſutably to the rank they hold. And in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60829:6"/> 
                  <hi>Geneva</hi> there is ſo great a regulation upon Expences of all ſorts, that a ſmall Sum goes a great way. It is a ſurpriſing thing, to ſee ſo much Learning as one finds in <hi>Geneva,</hi> not only among thoſe whoſe Profeſſion ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges them to Study, but among the Magiſtrates and Citizens; and if there are not many men of the firſt form of Learning among them, yet every body almoſt here has a good tincture of a learned Education; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that they are Maſters of the Latin, they know the Controverſies of Religion and Hiſtory, and they are generally men of good ſenſe.</p>
               <p>There is an univerſal Civility, not only towards Strangers, but towards one another, that reigns all the Town over, and leans to an exceſs; ſo that in them one ſees a mixture of a <hi>French</hi> Openneſs, and an <hi>Italian</hi> Exactneſs: there is indeed a little too much of the laſt.</p>
               <p>The publick Juſtice of the City is quick and good, and more commended than the private Juſtice of thoſe that deal in Trade: a want of Sincerity is much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by thoſe that know the Town wall. There is no publick Lewdneſs to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their Neighbourhood to the <hi>Switzers,</hi> drinking is very little known among them. One of the beſt parts of their Law is the way of ſelling Eſtates; which is likewiſe practiſed in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> and is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Subhaſtation,</hi> from the <hi>Roman</hi> Cuſtom of ſelling <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>haſta.</hi> A man that is to buy an Eſtate agrees with the Owner, and then intimates it to the Government; who order three ſeveral Proclamations to be made ſix Weeks one after another, of the intended Sale, that is to be on ſuch a day: when the day comes, the Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the Seller, if they apprehend that the Eſtate is ſold at an under-value, may out-bid the Buyer; but if they do not interpoſe, the Buyer delivers the money to the State, which upon that gives him his Title to the Eſtate, which can never be ſo much as brought
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60829:7"/> under a Debate in Law; and the price is paid into the State, and is by them given either to the Debtors of the Seller, if he owes money, or to the Seller himſelf.</p>
               <p>This Cuſtom prevails likewiſe in <hi>Swiſſe,</hi> where alſo twelve Years Poſſeſſion gives a Preſcription; ſo that in no place of the World are the Titles to Eſtates ſo ſecure as here. The Conſtitution of the Government is the ſame both in <hi>Geneva,</hi> and in moſt of the <hi>Cantons.</hi> The Sovereignty lies in the Council of Two hundred, and this Council chuſes out of its number Twenty five, who are the leſſer Council; and the cenſure of the Twenty five belongs to the great Council: they are choſen by a ſort of Ballet; ſo that it is not known for whom they give their Votes: which is an effectual method to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Factions and Reſentments; ſince in a competition no man can know who voted for him or againſt him: yet the Election is not ſo carried, but that the whole Town is in an Intrigue concerning it: for ſince the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the little Council leads one to the <hi>Sindicat,</hi> which is the chief Honour of the State; this Dignity is court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here with as active and ſollicitous an Ambition, as appears elſewhere for greater matters. The Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred are choſen and cenſured by the Twenty five; ſo that theſe two Councils, which are both for Life, are checks one upon another. The Magiſtracy is in the one, and the Sovereignty in the other. The Number of Twenty five is never exceeded in the leſſer Council; but for the greater, tho' it paſſes by the Name of the Council of Two hundred, yet there are commonly eight or ten more: ſo that notwithſtanding the abſence or ſickneſs of ſome of the Number, they may ſtill be able to call together near the full Number. There is another Council beſides theſe two, compoſed of Sixty, conſiſting of thoſe of the Two hundred that have borne Offices, ſuch as Auditors, Attorney-Generals, or thoſe that have been in other Employments, which are given for a determinate number of Years: This Court has
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60829:7"/> no Authority, but is called together by the Twenty five, when any extraordinary occaſion makes it advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable for them to call for a more general Concurrence in the Reſolutions that they are about to form. And this Council is of the nature of a Council of State that only gives Advice, but has no power in it ſelf to enforce its Advices. The whole Body of the Burgeſſes chuſes the Sindicks the firſt Sunday in the Year, and there are ſome other Elections that do likewiſe belong to them. The difference between the Burgeſſes and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens is, that the former degree may be bought or gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Strangers, and they are capable to be of the Two hundred: but none is a Citizen but he that is the Son of a Burgeſs, and that is born within the Town.</p>
               <p>I need ſay no more of the Conſtitution of this little Republick: Its chief ſupport is in the firm Alliance that has ſtood now ſo long between it and the <hi>Cantons</hi> of <hi>Bern</hi> and <hi>Zurich;</hi> and it is ſo viſibly the Intereſt of all <hi>Switzerland</hi> to preſerve it as the Key, by which it may be all laid open: that if the <hi>Cantons</hi> had not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten their Intereſt ſo palpably in ſuffering the <hi>French</hi> to become Maſters of the <hi>Franche Comtè,</hi> one would think that they would not be capable of ſuffering <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva</hi> to be touch'd: for all that can be done in fortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Town, can ſignifie no more, but to put it in caſe to reſiſt a Surpriſe or Scalade; ſince if a Royal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my comes againſt it to beſiege it in form, it is certain, that unleſs the <hi>Switzers</hi> come down with a Force able to raiſe the Siege, thoſe within will be able to make a very ſhort reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Geneva</hi> I went throngh the Country of <hi>Vaud</hi> or the <hi>Valley,</hi> and <hi>Lauſanne,</hi> its chief Town, in my way to <hi>Bern.</hi> The Town of <hi>Lauſanne</hi> is ſituated on three Hills, ſo that the whole Town is aſcent and deſcent, and that very ſteep, chiefly on the ſide on which the Church ſtands, which is a very noble Fabrick. The South-wall of the Croſs was ſo ſplit by an Earthquake about thirty years ago, that there was a rent made from
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60829:8"/> top to bottom above a foot wide; which was ſo cloſed up ten years after by another Earthquake, that now one only ſees where the breach was. This extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant ſituation of the Town was occaſioned by a Legend of ſome Miracles wrought near the Church: which prevailed ſo much on the Credulity of that Age, that by it the Church, and ſo in conſequence the Buildings near it, were added to the old Town, which ſtood on the other Hill, where there was a Town made on the High-way from the Lake into <hi>Switzerland,</hi> to which the chief Priviledges of the Town, particularly the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature of Life and Death, do ſtill belong. Between <hi>Geneva</hi> and this, lies the Lake which at the one end is called the Lake of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and at the other the Lake of <hi>Lauſanne.</hi> I need not mention the Dimenſions of it which are ſo well known, only in ſome Places the depth has never been found, for it is more than five hundred Fathom: The banks of the Lake are the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifulleſt Plots of Ground that can be imagined, for they look as if they had been laid by art: the ſloping is ſo eaſie and ſo equal, and the Grounds are ſo well culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated and peopled, that a more delighting Proſpect cannot be ſeen any where: The Lake is well ſtock'd with excellent Fiſh; but their Numbers do ſenſibly decreaſe, and one ſort is quite loſt: it is not only to be aſcribed to the ravenouſneſs of the Pikes that abound in it, but to another ſort of Fiſh that they call <hi>Moutails,</hi> which were never taken in the Lake untill within ſix years laſt paſt: they are in the Lake of <hi>Neuf-chaſtel,</hi> and ſome of the other Lakes of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> and it is likely that by ſome conveyance under ground they may have come into Channels that fall into the Lake: the Water of the Lake is all clear and freſh. It is not only a great Pond made by the <hi>Rhoſne</hi> that runs into it, but does not paſs through it unmix'd, as ſome Travellers have fondly imagined, becauſe ſometimes a ſoft Gale makes a curling of the Waters in ſome places, which runs ſmooth in the places over which that ſoft breath

                  </gap>s, the Gale varying its place often. But it is believed that there are alſo many great Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains all over the Lake: theſe Springs d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

And on the two ſides of the <hi>Alps,</hi> both North and South, there is ſo great a number of thoſe little Seas, that it may be eaſily gheſſed they muſt have vaſt Sorces that feed ſo conſtantly thoſe huge Ponds. And when one conſiders the height of thoſe Hills, the chain of ſo many of them together, and their extent both in length and breadth; if at firſt he thinks of the old Fables of laying one Hill upon the top of another, he will be afterwards apt to imagine, according to the ingenious Conjecture of one that tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled over them oftner than once, that theſe cannot be the primary Productions of the Author of Nature, but are the vaſt ruines of the firſt World, which at the Deluge broke here into ſo many Inequalities.</p>
               <p>One Hill not far from <hi>Geneva,</hi> called <hi>Maudit,</hi> or Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, of which one Third is always covered with Snow, is two miles of perpendicular height, according to the Obſervation of that incomparable Mathematician and Philoſopher, <hi>Nicolas Fatio Duilier,</hi> who at Twenty two Years of Age is already one of the greateſt men of his Age, and ſeems to be born to carry Learning ſome ſizes beyond what it has yet attain'd.</p>
               <p>But now I will entertain you a little with the State of <hi>Bern,</hi> for that Canton alone is above a third part of all <hi>Switzerland.</hi> I will ſay nothing of its Beginnings nor Hiſtory: nor will I enlarge upon the Conſtitutions which are all well known. It has a Counſel of Two hundred, that goes by that Name, tho' it conſiſts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of Three hundred; and another of Twenty five, as <hi>Geneva.</hi> The chief Magiſtrates are two <hi>Advoyers,</hi> who are not annual, as the Sindicks of <hi>Geneva,</hi> but are for life, and have an Authority not unlike that of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60829:9"/> 
                  <hi>Roman</hi> Conſuls; each being his Year by turns the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyer</hi> in Office. After them there are the four <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerets,</hi> who anſwer to the Tribunes of the People in <hi>Rome:</hi> then come the two <hi>Burſars</hi> or Treaſurers, one for the ancient <hi>German</hi> Territory, the other for the <hi>French</hi> Territory or the Country of <hi>Vaud,</hi> and the two laſt, choſen of the Twenty five, are called the Secrets; for to them all Secrets relating to the State are diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered: and they have an Authority of calling the Two hundred together when they think fit, and of accuſing thoſe of the Magiſtracy, the <hi>Advoyers</hi> themſelves not excepted, as they ſee cauſe; tho' this falls out ſeldom.</p>
               <p>There are ſeventy two Bailiages, into which the whole Canton of <hi>Bern</hi> is divided, and in every one of thoſe there is a Bailiff named by the Council of Two hundred, who muſt be a Citizen of <hi>Bern,</hi> and one of the Two hundred, to which Council no man can be choſen till he is married. Theſe Bailiages are Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments both of Honour and Profit; for the Bailiff is the Governour and Judge in that Juriſdiction: ſince tho' he has ſome Aſſeſſors who are choſen out of the Baili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, yet he may by his Authority carry matters which way he will, againſt all their Opinions: and the Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffs have all the Confiſcations and Fines; ſo that Drinking being ſo common in the Country, and that producing many Quarrels, the Bailiff makes his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of all thoſe diſorders: and in the ſix years of his Government according to the quality of his Bailiage, he not only lives by it, but will carry perhaps twenty thouſand Crowns with him back to <hi>Bern;</hi> on which he lives till he can carry another Bailiage; for one is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being twice Bailiff: but tho' ſome have been thrice Bailiffs, this is very extraordinary. The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of the Bailiff are the only Impoſitions or Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to which the Inhabitants are ſubjected; and theſe falling only on the Irregularities and Diſorders of the more debauched, makes that this Grievance, tho' in ſome particulas Caſes it preſſes hard, yet is not ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60829:9"/> felt: for a ſober and regular man is in no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Many in this Canton are as in <hi>England,</hi> Lords of Caſtles and Mannors, and have a Juriſdiction an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to their Eſtates, and name their Magiſtrate, who is called the <hi>Caſtellan,</hi> In matters of ſmall conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence there lies no Appeal from him to the Bailiff; but beyond the value of two Piſtols an Appeal lies; and no Sentence of Death is executed till it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed at <hi>Bern.</hi> There lies alſo an Appeal from the Bailiff to the Council at <hi>Bern.</hi> There are many Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the injuſtice of the Bailiffs; but their Law is ſhort and clear, ſo that a Sute is ſoon ended: two or three Hearings is the moſt that even an intricate Sute amounts to, either in the firſt Inſtance before the Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff, or in the ſecond Judgment at <hi>Bern.</hi> The Citizens of <hi>Bern</hi> conſider theſe Bailiages as their Inheritance, and they are courted in this State, perhaps, with as much Intrigue as was ever uſed among the <hi>Romans</hi> in the diſtribution of their Provinces: and ſo little ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the beſt Regulations when there are intrinſick Diſeaſes in a State, that though there is all poſſible Precaution uſed in the Nomination of theſe Bailiffs, yet that has not preſerved this State from falling under ſo great a miſchief by thoſe little Provinces; that as it has already in a great meaſure corrupted their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, ſo it may, likely, turn in Concluſion to the Ruine of this Republick. All the Electors give their Voices by Ballot; ſo that they are free from all after-Game in the Nomination of the Perſon; All the Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of the Pretenders, even to the remoteſt degrees, are excluded from Voting, as are alſo all their Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; ſo that none can vote, but thoſe who ſeem to have no intereſt in the Iſſue of the Competition: and yet there is ſo much Intrigue, and ſo great Corruption in the diſtribution of theſe Imployments, That the whole Buſineſs, in which all <hi>Bern</hi> is ever in motion, is the catching of the beſt Bailiages, on which a Family will have its Eye for many Years before they fall. For
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60829:10"/> the Counſellors of <hi>Bern</hi> give a very ſmall ſhare of their Eſtates to their Children when they marry them: all that they purpoſe is, to make a Bailiage ſure to them: for this they feaſt and drink, and ſpare nothing by which they may make ſure a ſufficient number of Votes: but it is the Chamber of the <hi>Bannerets</hi> that admits the Pretenders to the Competition. When the Bailiff is choſen, he takes all poſſible methods to make the beſt of it he can, and lets few Crimes paſs that carry either Confiſcations or Fines after them: his Juſtice alſo is generally ſuſpected. It is true, thoſe of the Bailiage may complain to the Council at <hi>Bern,</hi> as the oppreſſed Provinces did anciently to the Senate of <hi>Rome:</hi> and there have been ſevere Judgments againſt ſome more exorbitant Bailiffs; yet as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints are not made, except upon great Occaſions, which are not often given by the Bailiffs, ſo it being the general Intereſt of the Citizens of <hi>Bern</hi> to make all poſſible Advantages of thoſe Imployments, the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure will be but gentle, except the Complaint is crying.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Bern</hi> there is very little Trade, only what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the ſupport of the Towns They maintain Profeſſors in the Univerſities of <hi>Bern</hi> and <hi>Lauſanne,</hi> the one for the <hi>German</hi> Territory, which is the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Canton, and the other for the new Conqueſt, which is the <hi>French.</hi> In the former there are about three hundred Pariſhes, in the other there are but about a hundred and fifty: but in the Benefices of the <hi>German</hi> ſide, the ancient Rights of the Incumbents are generally preſerved, ſo that ſome Benefices are worth a thouſand Crowns; whereas in the <hi>Pais des Vaud</hi> the Proviſions are generally from a hundred to two hundred Crowns. It is viſible that thoſe of <hi>Bern</hi> truſt more to the Affections and Fidelity of their Subjects, than to the ſtrength of their Walls: for as they have never finiſhed them, ſo what is built cannot be brought to a regular Fortification; and it is not
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60829:10"/> preſerved with any care, nor furniſhed with Canon; but if they have none on their Ramparts, they have good ſtore in their Arſenal, in which they ſay there are Arms for forty thouſand men.</p>
               <p>The Peaſants are generally rich, chiefly in the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> ſide, and are all well armed: they pay no Duties to the Publick; and the Soil is capable of great Culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, in which ſome ſucceed ſo well, that I was ſhewed ſome that were by accident at <hi>Bern,</hi> who, as I was told, had of Eſtate to the value of a hundred thouſand Crowns, but that is not ordinary; yet ten thouſand Crowns for a Peaſant is no extraordinary matter. They live much on their Milk and Corn, which in ſome Places, as about <hi>Payern,</hi> yields an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of fifteen meaſures after one: they breed many Horſes, which bring them in a great deal of money. The worſt thing in the Country is the moiſture of the Air, which is not only occaſioned by the many Lakes that are in it, and the Neighbouring Mountains that are covered with Snow, ſome all the Summer long, and the reſt till Mid-ſummer; but by the vaſt quantity of Woods of Fir-trees, which ſeem to fill very near the half of their Soil; and if theſe were for the moſt part rooted out, as they would have much more Soil, ſo their Air would be much purer; yet till they find either Coal or Turf for their Fewel this cannot be done. I was told that they had found Coal in ſome Places. If the Coal is conveniently ſituated, ſo that by their Lakes and Rivers it can be eaſily carried over the Country, it may ſave them a great extent of ground, that as it is covered with Wood, ſo the Air becomes thereby the more unwholſome.</p>
               <p>They have ſome Fountains of Salt-water; but the making Salt conſumes ſo much Wood, that hitherto it has not turn'd to any Account.</p>
               <p>The Men are generally ſincere, but heavy: they think it neceſſary to correct the moiſture of the Air with liberal Entertainments, and they are well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60829:11"/> with all neceſſary Ingredients: for as their Soil produces good Cattel, ſo their Lakes abound in Fiſh, and their Woods in Fowl, the Wine is alſo light and good. The Women are generally employed in their domeſtick Affairs, and the Wives even of the chief Magiſtrates of <hi>Bern</hi> look into all the Concerns of the Houſe and Kitchin as much as the Wives of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Peaſants. Men and Women do not converſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly together; and the Women are ſo much amuſed with the Management at home, and enter ſo little into Intrigues, that among them, as an eminent Phyſician there told me, they know not what Vapours are, which he imputed to the Idleneſs and Intrigues that abound elſewhere, whereas he ſaid, among them the Blood was cleanſed by their Labour, and as that made them ſleep well, ſo they did not amuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with much thinking, nor did they know what Amours were.

               <p>The whole State is diſpoſed for War, for every man that can bear Arms is liſted, and knows his Poſt and Arms; and there are Beacons ſo laid over the Country, that the Signal can run over the whole Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60829:11"/> in a night: and their Military Liſts are ſo laid, that every man knows whither he is to come out upon firſt or ſecond, or not till the general Summons. They aſſured me at <hi>Bern,</hi> That upon a general Summons they could bring above eighty thouſand Men together. The Men are robuſt and ſtrong, and capable of great Hardſhip, and of good Diſcipline, and have generally an extream ſenſe of Liberty, and a great Love to their Country; but they labour under a want of Officers. And tho' the Subjects of the State are rich, yet the Publick is poor: they can well reſiſt a ſudden Invaſion of their Country, but they would ſoon grow weary of a long War: and the Soil requires ſo much Cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they could not ſpare from their Labour the Men that would be neceſſary to preſerve their Country. They were indeed as happy as a People could be, when the Emperour had <hi>Alſace</hi> on the one hand, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had the <hi>Franche Comté</hi> on the other; they had no reaſon to fear their Neighbours: but now that both thoſe Provinces are in the hands of the <hi>French,</hi> the caſe is quite altered; for as <hi>Baſil</hi> is every moment in danger from the Garriſon of <hi>Hunningen,</hi> that is but a Canon ſhot diſtant from it, ſo all the <hi>Pais de Vaud</hi> lies open to the <hi>Franche Comté,</hi> and has neither fortified Places, nor good Paſſes to ſecure it; ſo that their Error in ſuffering this to fall into the hands of the <hi>French</hi> was ſo groſs, that I took ſome pains to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed concerning it, and will here give you this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that I had from one who was then in a very emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Poſt; ſo that as he certainly knew the Secret, he ſeemed to ſpeak ſincerely to me. He told me that the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> had often moved in the Councils of War, That the Invaſion of <hi>France</hi> ought to be made on that ſide in which <hi>France</hi> lay open, and was very ill fortified: This he repeated often, and it was known in <hi>France:</hi> ſo that the King reſolved to poſſeſs himſelf of the <hi>Comtê,</hi> but uſed that Precaution, that fearing to provoke the <hi>Switſers,</hi> he offred a Neutrality on that

                  <hi>Zurich</hi> and <hi>Bern</hi> thought this was both inhumane and unchriſtian, tho' the Deputy of <hi>Baſil</hi> was of another mind, and thought that they ought to be delivered up, which extreamly diſguſted thoſe of <hi>Zurich.</hi> Thoſe of <hi>Schwitz</hi> committed ſome Inſolencies upon the Subjects of <hi>Zurich,</hi> and refuſed to give Satisfaction. Upon all which a War followed between the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi> and <hi>Popiſh</hi> Cantons. The Cantons of <hi>Bern</hi> and <hi>Zurich</hi> raiſed an Army of Twenty five thouſand Men, which was commanded by Mr. <hi>d' Erlack,</hi> but was diſperſed in ſeveral Bodies: And the Papiſts had not above Six thouſand, yet they ſurpriſed Mr. <hi>d' Erlack</hi> with a Body not much ſuperiour to theirs: both ſides, after a ſhort Engagement, run: The Canon of the Canton of <hi>Bern</hi> was left in the Field a whole day; at laſt thoſe of <hi>Lucern</hi> ſeeing that none ſtayed to defend the Canon, carried them off: This loſs raiſed ſuch a Tumult in <hi>Bern,</hi> that they ſeemed reſolved to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice Mr. <hi>d' Erlack;</hi> but he came with ſuch a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Mind, and gave ſo ſatisfying an Account of the Misfortune, that the Tumult ceaſed, and ſoon after the War ended. Upon this many thought, that tho' the <hi>Papiſts</hi> acted cruelly, yet it was according to their Laws, and that no other Canton could pretend to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe or quarrel with thoſe of <hi>Schwitz,</hi> for what they did upon that occaſion. Within theſe few Years there were ſome Quarrels like to ariſe in the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton of <hi>Glaris,</hi> where it was ſaid the equal Priviledges agreed on to both Religions, were not preſerved, but on this occaſion the Pope's <hi>Nuntio</hi> acted a very different Part from that which might have been expected from him: for whereas the Miniſters of that Court have been commonly the Incendiaries in all the Diſputes that concern Religion, he acted ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the part of a Mediator; and whereas it was viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the Injuſtice lay on the ſide of the Papiſts, he interpoſed ſo effectually with thoſe of <hi>Lucern,</hi> which is the chief of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Cantons, that the difference was compoſed.</p>

The great Church of <hi>Bern</hi> is a very noble Fabrick: but being built on the top of the Hill on which the Town ſtands, it ſeems the ground began to fail; ſo to ſupport it they have raiſed a vaſt Fabrick, which has coſt more than the Church it ſelf: for there is a Platform made, which is a Square to which the Church is one ſide, and the farther ſide is a vaſt Wall, fortified with Buttreſſes about a hundred and fifty foot high. They told me, That all the Ground, down to the bottom of the Hill, was dug into Vaults: This Platform is the chief Walk of the Town, chiefly about Sun-ſet: and the River underneath preſents a very beautiful Proſpect; for there is a Cur taken off from it for the Mills, but all along as this Cur goes the Water of <hi>Aar</hi> runs, over a ſtoping bank of Stone, which they ſay was made at a vaſt Charge, and makes a noble and large Caſcade.</p>

I am the more able to give a particular account of it, becauſe I read the Original Proceſs in the <hi>Latin</hi> Record ſigned by the Notaries of the Court of the Delegates that the Pope ſent to try the matter. The Record is a hundred and thirty Sheets writ cloſe and of all ſides,

               <p>The two famous Orders that had poſſeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the eſteem of thoſe dark Ages were engaged in a mighty Rivalry. The <hi>Dominicans</hi> were the more learned, They were the eminenteſt Preachers of thoſe Times, and had the Conduct of the Courts of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, and the other chief Offices in the Church in their hands. But on the other hand, the <hi>Franciſcans</hi> had an outward Appearance of more Severity, a ruder Habit, ſtricter Rules, and greater Poverty: all which gave them ſuch advantages in the eyes of the ſimple multitude, as were able to ballance the other Honours of the <hi>Dominican</hi> Order. In ſhort, The two Orders were engaged in a high Rivalry; but the Devotion towards the Virgin being the prevailing Paſſion of thoſe Times, the <hi>Franciſcans</hi> upon this had great Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages. The <hi>Dominicans,</hi> that are all engaged in the Defence of <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi>'s Opinions, were thereby obliged to aſſert that ſhe was born in Original Sin: this was propoſed to the People by the <hi>Franciſcans</hi> as no leſs than Blaſphemy; and by this the <hi>Dominicans</hi> began to loſe ground extreamly in the minds of the People, who were ſtrongly prepoſſeſſed in favours of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate Conception.</p>
               <p>About the beginning of the fifteenth Century, a <hi>Franciſcan</hi> happened to preach in <hi>Francfort,</hi> and one <hi>Wigand</hi> a <hi>Dominican</hi> coming into the Church, the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delier</hi> ſeeing him, brake out into Exclamations, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God that he was not of an Order that profaned the Virgin, or that poiſoned Princes in the Sacrament, (for a <hi>Dominican</hi> had poiſoned the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh with the Sacrament.) <hi>Wigand</hi> being extreamly provoked with this bloody Reproach, gave him the Lye: upon which a Diſpute aroſe, which ended in a Tumult, that had almoſt coſt the <hi>Dominican</hi> his Life:

When the injoyned Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Friar fancied the Voice reſembled the Priors a little: but he was then ſo far from ſuſpecting any thing, that he gave no great heed to this ſuſpicion. Some days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60829:17"/> this, the ſame Friar appeared as a Nun all in glory, and told the poor Friar that ſhe was St. <hi>Barbara,</hi> for whom he had a particular Devotion, and added, that the B. Virgin was ſo much pleaſed with his Charity, that ſhe intended to come and viſit him. He imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately called the Convent together, and gave the reſt of the Fri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

After ſome days the longed for deluſion appeared to him, cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the Virgin uſed to be on the great Feaſts, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in the ſame Habits: there were about her ſome Angels, which he afterwards found were the little ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

There was alſo a pulley faſtned in the Room over his head, and a Cord tied to the Angels, that made them riſe up in the Air, and flie about the Virgin, which increaſed the Deluſion. The Virgin, after ſome endearments to himſelf, extolling the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of his Charity and Diſcipline, told him, That ſhe was conceived in original ſin, and that Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the Second, that then reigned, was to put an end to the Diſpute, and was to aboliſh the Feaſt of her Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fourth had inſtituted, and that the Friar was to be the Inſtrument of perſwading the Pope of the truth in that matter. She gave him three drops of her Sons Blood, which were th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ee tears of Blood that he had ſhed over <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and this ſignified that ſhe was three hours in original Sin, after which ſhe was, by his mercy, delivered out of that State: for it ſeems the <hi>Dominicans</hi> were reſolved ſo to compound the matter, that they ſhould gain the main Point of her Conception in Sin, yet they would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſo far with the Reverence for the Virgin, with which the World was poſſeſſed, that ſhe ſhould be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to have remained a very ſhort while in that State. She gave him alſo five drops of Blood in the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60829:17"/> form of a Croſs, which were Tears of Blood that ſhe had ſhed while her Son was on the Croſs. And, to convince him more fully, ſhe preſented an Hoſty to him, that appeared as an ordinary Hoſty, and of a ſudden it appeared to be of a deep red colour. The Cheat of thoſe ſuppoſed Viſits was often repeated to the abuſed Friar; at laſt the Virgin told him that ſhe was to give him ſuch marks of her Son's Love to him, that the matter ſhould be paſt all doubt. She ſaid, That the five Wounds of St. <hi>Lucia</hi> and St. <hi>Catharine</hi> were real Wounds, and that ſhe would alſo imprint them on him, ſo ſhe bid him reach his hand: he had no great mind to receive a Favour in which he was to ſuffer ſo much: but ſhe forced his hand and ſtruck a Nail through it; the Hole was as big as a Grain of Peaſe, and he ſaw the Candle clearly through it: this threw him out of a ſuppoſed Tranſport into a real Agony: but ſhe ſeemed to touch his Hand, and he thought he ſmelt an Oyntment with which ſhe anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, tho' his Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>feſſor perſwaded him that that was only an Imagination: ſo the ſuppoſed Virgin left him for that time.</p>
               <p>The next Night the Apparition returned, and brought ſome linnen Cloaths, which had ſome real or imaginary vertue to allay his torment: and the pretended Virgin ſaid, they were ſome of the linings in which <hi>Chriſt</hi> was wrapped, and with that ſhe gave him a ſoporiferous draught, and while he was faſt aſleep, the other four Wounds were imprinted on his body in ſuch a manner that he felt no pain.</p>
               <p>But in order to the doing of this, the Friars be took themſelves to Charms, and the Subprior ſhewed the reſt a Book full of them: but he ſaid that before they could be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60829:18"/> of the Draught was a mixture of ſome Fountain-water and Chriſme the Hairs of the Eye-brows of a Child, ſome Quick-ſilver, ſome Grains of Incenſe, ſomewhat of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

By this the poor Friar, <hi>Jetzer</hi> was made almoſt quite inſenſible. When he was awake and came out of this deep ſleep, he felt this wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Impreſſion on his Body, and now he was ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He was expoſed to the people on the great Altar, to the amazement of the whole Town, and to the no ſmall Mortification of the <hi>Franciſcans.</hi> The <hi>Dominicans</hi> gave him ſome other Draughts, that threw him into Convulſions: and when he came out of thoſe, a Voice was heard, which came through that Hole which yet remains and runs from one of the Cells along a great part of the Wall of the Church: for a Friar ſpoke thro' a Pipe, and at the end of the Hole there was an Image of the Virgins with a little <hi>Jeſus</hi> in her Arms, between whom and his Mother the Voice ſeemed to come; the Image alſo ſeemed to ſhed Tears: and a Painter had drawn thoſe on her Face ſo lively, that the People were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by it. The little <hi>Jeſus</hi> ask'd why ſhe wept; and ſhe ſaid it was becauſe his Honour was given to her, ſince it was ſaid, That ſhe was born without ſin. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n concluſion, the Friars did ſo over-act this Matter, that at laſt ev'n the poor deluded Frier himſelf came to diſcover it, and reſolved to quit the Order.</p>
               <p>It was in vain to delude him with more Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for he well nigh kill'd a Frier that came to him perſonating the Virgin in another ſhape, with a Crown on her Head. He alſo over-heard the Friers once talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amongſt themſelves of the Contrivance and Succeſs of the Impoſture, ſo plainly, that he diſcovered the whole matter, and upon that, as may be eaſily imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60829:18"/> he was filled with all the horror with which ſuch a Diſcovery could inſpire him.</p>
               <p>The Friers fearing that an Impoſture, which was carried on hitherto with ſo much ſucceſs, ſhould be quite ſpoiled, and be turned againſt them, thought the ſureſt way was to own the whole matter to him, and to engage him to carry on the Cheat. They told him in what eſteem he would be, if he continued to ſupport the Reputation that he had acquired, that he would become the chief perſon of the Order, and in the end they perſuaded him to go on with the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture. But at laſt they, fearing leſt he ſhould diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all, reſolved to poyſon him: of which he was ſo apprehenſive, that once a Loaf being brought him that was prepared with ſome Spices, he kept it for ſome time, and it growing green, he threw it to ſome young Wolves Whelps that were in the Monaſtery, who died immediately. His Conſtitution was alſo ſo vigorous, that tho' they gave him Poyſon five ſeveral times, he was not deſtroyed by it. They alſo preſt him earneſtly to renounce God, which they judg'd neceſſary, that ſo their Charms might have their effect on him; but he would never conſent to that: at laſt they forced him to take a poiſoned Hoſty, which yet he vomited up ſoon after he had ſwallowed it down: that failing, they uſed him ſo cruelly, whipping him with an iron Chain, and girding him about ſo ſtrait with it, that to avoid farther torment, he ſwore to them, in a moſt imprecating ſtile, That he would never diſcover the Secret, but would ſtill carry it on: and ſo he deluded them, till he found an opportunity of getting out of the Convent, and of throwing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the Hands of the Magiſtrates, to whom he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered all.</p>
               <p>The four Friers were ſeiſed on, and put in Priſon, and an account of the whole Matter was ſent, firſt to the Biſhop of <hi>Lauſanne</hi> and then to <hi>Rome;</hi> and it may be eaſily imagined, that the <hi>Franciſcans</hi> took all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60829:19"/> care to have it well examined; and the Biſhops of <hi>Lauſanne</hi> and of <hi>Zyon,</hi> with the Provincial of the <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicans,</hi> were appointed to form the Proceſs. The four Friers firſt excepted to <hi>Jetzers</hi> Credit, but that was rejected; then being threatned with the Queſtion they put in a long Plea againſt that: but tho' the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial would not conſent to that, yet they were put to the Queſtion: ſome endured it long, but at laſt they all confeſſed the whole progreſs of the Impoſture. The Provincial appeared concerned: for tho' <hi>Jetzer</hi> had opened the whole matter to him, yet he would give no credit to him; on the contrary, he charged him to be obedient to them; and one of the Friers ſaid plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he was on the whole Secret, and ſo he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, but he died ſome days after at <hi>Constance,</hi> having poiſon'd himſelf, as was believed. The matter lay aſleep ſome time: but a year after that, a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop came, authoriſed with full Powers from <hi>Rome,</hi> and the whole Cheat being fully proved, the four Friers were ſolemnly degraded from their Prieſthood, and eight days after, it being the laſt of <hi>May</hi> 1509, they were burnt in a Meadow on the other ſide of the River over againſt the great Church. The place of their Execution was ſhewed me, as well as the Hole in the Wall thro' which the Voice was conveyed to the Image.

And in many Letters writ on that Subject, it is aſſerted, That both <hi>Cranmer</hi> and <hi>Ridley</hi> intended to procure an Act for aboliſhing the Habits, and that they only defended their Lawfulneſs, but not their Fitneſs; and therefore they blamed private Perſons that refuſed to obey the Laws. <hi>Grindal,</hi> in a Letter dated the Twenty ſeventh of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1566. writes, That all the Biſhops, who had been beyond Sea, had at their Return dealt with the Queen to let the matter of the Habits fall: but ſhe was ſo prepoſſeſſed, that tho' they had all endeavoured to divert her from proſecuting that matter, ſhe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſtill inflexible. This had made them reſolve to ſubmit to the Laws, and to wait for a fit opportunity to reverſe them. He laments the ill effects of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that ſome had made to them, which extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly irritated the Queens Spirit, ſo than ſhe was now much more heated in thoſe matters than formerly:

On all theſe Paſſages I will make no Reflections here: for I ſet them down only to ſhew what was the ſenſe of our chief Church-men at that time, concerning thoſe matters, which have ſince engaged us into ſuch warm and angry Diſputes; and this may be no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Inſtruction to one that intends to write the Hiſtory of that time. The laſt particular with which I intend to end this Letter, might ſeem a little too learned, if I were writing to a leſs knowing Man than your ſelf.</p>
               <p>I have taken ſome pains in my Travels to examine all the Ancient Manuſcripts of the New Teſtament, concerning that doubted Paſſage of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Epiſtle, <hi>There are three that bear Witneſs in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Spirit, and theſe three are one. Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linger</hi> doubted much of it, becauſe he found it not in an ancient <hi>Latin</hi> Manuſcript at <hi>Zurich,</hi> which ſeems to be about eight hundred years old; for it is written in that hand that began to be uſed in <hi>harles</hi> the Great's time. I turned the Manuſcript, and found the Paſſage was not there: but this was certainly the error or omiſſion of the Copier: for before the General Epiſtles in that Manuſcript, the Preface of St <hi>Jerom</hi>'s is to be found; in which he ſays, that he was the more exact in that T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60829:24"/> the Trinity. This Preface is printed in <hi>Lira</hi>'s Bible; but how it came to be left out by <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> in his Edition of that Father's Works, is that of which I can give no Account: for as on the one hand <hi>Eraſmus</hi>'s Sincerity ought not to be too raſhly cenſured, ſo on the other hand, that Preface being in all the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts, ancient or modern, of thoſe Bibles that have the other Prefaces in them that I ever yet ſaw, it is not eaſie to imagine what made <hi>Eraſmus</hi> not to publiſh it: and it is in the Manuſcript Bibles at <hi>Baſle,</hi> where he printed his Edition of St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s Works. In the old Manuſcript Bible of <hi>Geneva,</hi> that ſeems to be above ſeven hundred Years old, both the Preface and the Paſſage are extant, but with this difference from the common Editions, that the common Editions ſet the Verſe concerning <hi>the Father, the Word, and the Spirit,</hi> before that of <hi>the Water, the Blood, and the Spirit;</hi> which comes after it in this Copy. And that I may in this place end all the Readings I found of this Paſſage in my Travels, there is a Manuſcript in St. <hi>Mark's</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary in <hi>Venice</hi> in three Languages, <hi>Greek, Latin,</hi> and <hi>Arabick,</hi> that ſeems not above four hundred Years old, in which this Paſſage is not in the <hi>Greek,</hi> but it is in the <hi>Latin</hi> ſet after the other three, with a <hi>ſicut</hi> to joyn it to what goes before. And in a Manuſcript <hi>Latin</hi> Bible in the Library of St. <hi>Laurence</hi> at <hi>Florence,</hi> both St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s Preface and this Paſſage are extant: but this Paſſage comes after the other, and is pinned to it with a <hi>ſicut,</hi> as is that of <hi>Venice;</hi> yet <hi>ſicut</hi> is not in the <hi>Geneva</hi> Manuſcript.

In two of the other the Prologue is extant, but the Place is not; only in one of them it is added on the Margent.

There is indeed the famous <hi>Greek</hi> Manuſcript of great value, which the Chanoine <hi>Shelſtrat,</hi> that was Library-Keeper, aſſerted to be One thouſand four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years old, and proved it by the great ſimilitude of the Characters with thoſe that are upon St. <hi>Hippolite</hi>'s Statue, which is ſo evident, that if his Statue was made about his time, the Antiquity of this Manuſcript is not to be diſputed. If the Characters are not ſo fair, and have not all the marks of Antiquity that appears in the King's Manuſcript at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, yet this has been much better preſerved, and is much more entire.

The Biſhop had ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts with his Dean, and being a Prince of the Empire he had proſcribed him: the Dean had alſo behaved himſelf ſo inſolently, that by an order of the Diet, to which even the Biſhop, as was believed, conſented, he was put in Priſon as he came out of the Cathedral. By the common conſent both of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> Communities, a Law was long ago made againſt Eccleſiaſtical Immunities: this attempt on the Dean was made four years ago; as ſoon as he was let out, he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> and made great Complaints of the Biſhop, and it was thought the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Party intended to move in the Diet while we were there, for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing of that Law, but they did it nor. The foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the quarrel between the Biſhop and Dean, was the Exemptions to which the Dean and Chapter pretended, and upon which the Biſhop made ſome invaſion. Upon which I took occaſion to ſhew him the novelty of thoſe Exemptions, and that in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church it was believed that the Biſhop had the Authority over his Presbyters by a Divine Right; and if it was by a Divine Right, then the Pope could not exempt them from his Obedience: but the Biſhop would not carry the matter ſo high, and contented himſelf with two maxims; the one was, <hi>That the Biſhop was</hi> Chriſt's <hi>Vicar in his Dioceſs:</hi> and the other was, <hi>That what the Pope was in the Catholick-Church, the Biſhop was the ſame in his Dioceſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was a good natured man, and did not make uſe of the great Authority that he has over the <hi>Papiſts</hi> there, to ſet them on to live uneaſily wth their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of another Religion. That Biſhop was anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently a great Prince, and the greateſt part of the League that carries ſtill the Name of <hi>The Houſe of God,</hi> belonged to him, tho' I was aſſured that <hi>Pregallia,</hi> one of theſe Communities was a Free-State above Six hundred years ago, and that they have Records yet extant that prove this: The other Communities to

               <p>The Biſhop hath yet reſerved a Revenue of about One thouſand pound ſterling a year, and every one of the Prebendaries hath near Two hundred pound a year.

The Government here is purely a Common-wealth, for in the Choice of their Magiſtrates every man that is above ſixteen years Old hath his voice, which is alſo the Conſtitution of ſome of the ſmall Cantons.

The Authority of theſe Barons was formerly more abſolute than it is now, for the Subjects were their Slaves: but to keep together the little Village, they have granted them a power of naming a liſt for their Magiſtrates, the perſon being to be named by the Baron; who hath alſo the Right of Pardoning, a Right of Coining, and every thing alſo that belongs to a Soveraign.

               <p>All the other parts of this State are purely Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical, there are Three different Bodies or Leagues, and every one of theſe are an intire Government, and the Aſſembly or Diet of the Three Leagues, is only a Confederacy like the United Provinces or the Cantons: There are Sixty-ſeven Voices in the general Diet, which are thus divided: the league of the <hi>Griſons</hi> hath twenty-eight Voices, that of the <hi>Houſe of God</hi> hath twenty four, and that of the <hi>Juriſdictions</hi> hath fifteen. The <hi>Juriſdictions</hi> belonged anciently to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> but they having ſhaken off that Authority, were incorporated into the Diet, but in the laſt Wars of <hi>Germany,</hi> the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> thought to have brought them again under their yoke, yet they defended their Liberty with ſo much vigour, that the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> it ſeems thought the Conqueſt not worth the while, and that it would not quit the coſt. They were affrighted by two extraordinary actions; in one Village which was quite abandoned by all the Men belonging to it, who left the Women in it, ſome hundreds, as I was
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60829:30"/> told, were quartered, and were apprehenſive of no danger from their Hoſteſſes; but the Women inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to let their Husbands ſee that they were capable of contriving and executing a bold deſign; tho' it muſt be confeſt it was a little too rough and barbarous for the Sex: They entred into a Combination to cut the Throats of all the Souldiers at one time; the Woman that propoſed this had four lodged with her, and ſhe with her own hands diſpatcht them all, and ſo did all the reſt, not one Souldier eſcaping to carry away the News of ſo unheard of a Rage. In another place a Body of the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> came into a Valley that was quite abandoned, for the Men that had no Arms but their Clubs and Staves, got up to the Mountains; but they took their meaſures ſo well, and poſſeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo of the Paſſes, that they came down upon the Souldiers with ſo much fury, that they defeated them quite, ſo that very few eſcaped, and it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the ſubduing them would have proved a very hard work. It is true they are not in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to hold out long, the publick is ſo poor; ſo that tho' particular perſons are extream rich, yet they have no publick Revenue, but every man is concerned to preſerve his Liberty, which is more intire here than in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> but this often ſwells too much, and throws them into great convulſion. The league of the <hi>Griſons</hi> is the firſt and moſt ancient, and it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of eight and twenty Communities, of which there are eighteen <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and the reſt are <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> the Communities of the two Religions live Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourly together, yet they do not ſuffer thoſe of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Religion to live among them, ſo that every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity is intirely of the ſame Religion, and if any one changes he muſt go into another Community. Each Community is an intire State within it ſelf, and all Perſons muſt meet once a year to chuſe the Judge and his Aſſiſtants, whom they change or continne from year to year as they ſee cauſe: There is no difference

There is one choſen by the Deputies for the Aſſembly of the League, who is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the head of the League, that can call them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as he ſees cauſe, and can likewiſe bring a cauſe that hath been once judged, to a ſecond hearing. <hi>Ilants</hi> is the chief Town of this League, where their Diet meets. The ſecond League is that of the <hi>Houſe of God,</hi> in which there are four and twenty Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities; the Burgomaſter of <hi>Coire</hi> is always the head of this League: This League is almoſt wholly <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and the two Valleys of the upper and lower <hi>Engedin</hi> are pointed out by the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> as little leſs than <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibals</hi> towards ſuch <hi>Catholicks</hi> as come among them; but Frier <hi>Sſondrato,</hi> Nephew to Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, whoſe Mother the Marqueſs of <hi>Borgomaniero,</hi> that was in <hi>England,</hi> hath married, found the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary of all this to be true, to his great regret. About eighteen years ago he was believed to have wrought Miracles, and he became ſo much in love with the Crown of Martyrdom, that he went through the <hi>Engedm.</hi> not doubting but he would find there that which he deſired. His Brother had come ſometime before into the Countrey to drink mineral Waters, and was well known to the Gentry, ſo ſome of theſe hearing of the Friers coming, went and waited on him; and he was entertained by them in their Houſes and conveyed him through the Countrey; tho' he took all poſſible ways to provoke them, for he was often railing at their Religion, but to all that they

An accident fell out five year ago, that the People of the Country eſteemed a ſort of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> in their Proceſſions go ſometimes out of one Community into another, and when they paſs through <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Communities they lower the Croſs, and give over Singing till they are again upon <hi>Popiſh</hi> ground; but then they went on bearing up the Croſs, and ſinging as they went, upon which the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſtopt them, and would not ſuffer them to go on in that manner: they finding that they were not equal in number to the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> ſent to a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi> Community, and deſired them to come to their Aſſiſtance: Two thouſand came, and by all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance the diſpute would have had a bloody iſſue: for the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were reſolved to maintain the Rights of their Community, and the others were no leſs reſolved to force their way: but an extraordinary thick miſt aroſe, and through it the <hi>Papiſts</hi> fancied they ſaw a vaſt body of men, which was no other then a Wood: but terrified with the appearance of ſuch a Number they retired, and this ſaved a little Battel that probably would not only have ended in the ſhedding much Blood, but might have very much diſorder'd the whole Conſtitution and union of their Leagnes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Papiſts</hi> of Quality endeavour much to keep their People in order, but they acknowledged to my ſelf, that the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were much peaceabler than the <hi>Catholicks.</hi> The Juriſdictions have fifteen Votes in the general Diet, yet they are generally called the ten Juriſdictions, and the greater part of them are likewiſe of the Religion; for upon the general computation of the three Leagues, the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are about two thirds. In their Diets there are three Tables, one in the middle and two on either ſide, at every Table ſits
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60829:32"/> the head of the League and Secretary near him, and from the Table there goes down Benches on both hands for the Deputies from the communities of that league: They hold their Diets by turns in the chief Towns of the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The three Leagues have a conquered Country in <hi>Italy</hi> divided into three Diſtricts, the <hi>Valteline, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vennes,</hi> and <hi>Bormio.</hi> When <hi>John Galeaſſe</hi> poſſeſſed himſelf of the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> and drove out <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas, Maſtinus</hi> one of <hi>Barnabas</hi>'s Sons, to whom his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had given thoſe three Branches of the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> retired to <hi>Coire,</hi> and being hoſpitably received and entertained by the Biſhop, when he died he gave his Right to thoſe Territories to the Cathedral of <hi>Coire:</hi> but here was a Title without a force able to make it good. But when the Wars of <hi>Italy</hi> were on foot, the three Leagues being much courted by both the Crowns, ſince they were Maſters of the Paſſes by which either the <hi>Switzers</hi> or <hi>Germans</hi> could come into <hi>Italy,</hi> they reſolved to lay hold on that opportunity; yet they had not zeal enough for their Biſhop to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage deep upon his account: ſo they agreed with him to pay him ſuch a Revenue, and he transferred his Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to them; and they were ſo conſiderable to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that without much ado, they yielded thoſe parcels of the Dutchy of <hi>Milan</hi> to them, and by this means they are poſſeſſed of them. Thoſe Acceſſions to this State are much better than the principal; for as certainly the <hi>Valteline,</hi> which is above forty miles long and two broad, is one of the richeſt Valleys in the World, in which there are three Harveſts ſome years, ſo the <hi>Chavennes</hi> and <hi>Bormio</hi> are much preferable to the beſt Valleys of the <hi>Griſons;</hi> yet the engagement that people have to their native homes appears ſignally here, ſince the <hi>Griſons</hi> have not forſaken their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try that they might ſituate themſelves ſo advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly:

               <p>In the year 1618. there was a report ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t about, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had a treaty on foot to tear away the <hi>Valteline</hi> fram the leagues, this was ſupported by the Fort <hi>Fuentes,</hi> that the Governor of <hi>Milan</hi> was building upon the Lake of <hi>Como,</hi> near the <hi>Valteline.</hi> There was one <hi>Ganatz</hi> a Miniſter, but a bloody and perfidious Man, that ſet on and managed the rage of the Peaſants, and there was great reaſon to ſuſpect ſome underhand dealing, tho he threw it which way he pleaſed. A Chamber of Juſtice was appointed to ſit at <hi>Toſſane,</hi> which is a conſiderable Town twelve miles from <hi>Coire,</hi> on the way to <hi>Italy,</hi> near <hi>Alta Rhetia,</hi> which is a high and ſmall Hill, to which there is no acceſs but on one ſide, where there are yet the ruines of a Caſtle and a Church, and which they believe was the Pallace of <hi>Rhetus</hi> the firſt Prince of the Countrey: There was ſevere ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice done in this Chamber, a Prieſt was put to the queſtion, and ſo ill uſed that he died in it, which is a crying thing among them. The chief ſuſpicion lay upon one <hi>Pianta,</hi> who being of one of the beſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of the <hi>Griſons,</hi> was then one of the Captains in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Regiment; he withdrew himſelf from the ſtorm, but the Peaſants led on by <hi>Ganatz</hi> purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him ſo, that at laſt they found him and hewed him in pieces, <hi>Ganatz</hi> himſelf ſtriking the firſt ſtroke with an Ax, which was taken up and preſerved by his Friends, and four and twenty years after fifty or ſixty of his Friends fell upon <hi>Ganatz</hi> in <hi>Coire,</hi> and killed him with the ſame Ax, which they brought along with them, that they might execute their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign by the ſame tool with which their Friend was murthered, <hi>Ganatz</hi> had during the Wars abandoned both his Religion and Profeſſion, being, indeed, a diſgrace to both, and had ſerved firſt in the <hi>Venetian,</hi> and then in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Troops. After the peace was made he became ſo conſiderable, being ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60829:34"/> by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Faction, that he was choſen Governor of <hi>Chavennes,</hi> and was come over to <hi>Coire</hi> to a Diet, he being then in ſo important a charge: but he was ſo much hated, that tho the murthering of a Magiſtrate in Office, and at a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick aſſembly in ſo terrible a manner ought to have been ſeverely puniſhed, yet no inquiry was made into the crime, nor was any man ſo much as que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned for it. In that Chamber, many that were put to the queſtion confeſſed enough to hang them, ſome indured the queſtion and eſcaped with the loſs of the uſe of their Arm. Thoſe of the <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teline</hi> have made uſe of this ſeverity, as that which gave the riſe to the Maſſacre, and it is very probable this might have drawn in ſome, that would have been otherwiſe more moderate, and that it did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe precipitate that barbarous action: yet it was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards found out that the Plot had been formed long before, ſo that the induſtry and rage of the Prieſts managed by <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Emiſſaries, working upon the bigotry of the people was the real cauſe, and this was only made uſe of as a pretext to give ſome more plauſible colours to the Maſſacre, vvhich was executed ſome months after this Chamber was diſſolved. It began while the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were at Church, there were ſome hundreds deſtroyed, the reſt got all up to the Mountains, and ſo eſcaped into the Countrey of the <hi>Griſons,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Chavennes</hi> got likewiſe up to the Hills, for they are ſcituated juſt at the bottom of them.</p>

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60829:35"/> order vvas ſent to the Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> it vvas plain he had ſecret orders to the contrary, for he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to execute it: ſo a War follovved, in vvhich the <hi>Griſons</hi> found it vvas not eaſie for them to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the charge of it, vvithout imploying the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the <hi>French.</hi> But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> pretended to have no other intereſt in the affairs of the <hi>Valteline</hi> then the preſervation of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Religion, and to ſhevv their ſincerity, they put the Countrey into the Pope's hands, knovving that he could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it but by their aſſiſtance, nor reſtore it vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſecuring it from all change of Religion. The <hi>French</hi> vvillingly undertook the cauſe of the <hi>Griſons,</hi> and becauſe the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> vvas like to be the moſt favourable General, as being of the Religion, he vvas ſent to command ſome forces that mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched thither: But he ſavv that if the <hi>French</hi> once made themſelves Maſters of the paſſes of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, it vvould turn to their ruine, and finding the <hi>Griſons</hi> repoſed an intire confidence in him, he thought it unbecoming him to be an inſtrument in that vvhich he ſavv muſt be fatal to them. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſeeing the <hi>French</hi> ingage in the quarrel, and fearing leſt they ſhould poſſeſs themſelves of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, offered to reſtore all the Territory in <hi>Italy,</hi> for <hi>Chavennes</hi> and <hi>Bormio</hi> had likevviſe revolted, only the <hi>Preteſtants</hi> got avvay ſo quick upon the diſorders in the <hi>Valteline,</hi> that they prevented the rage of the Prieſts. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> ask'd theſe conditions, that an Amneſty ſhould be granted for vvhat vvas paſt, that there ſhould be no exerciſe of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> Religion tolerated in the Countrey, and that even the Bailiffs and other Magiſtrates of the Religion, that came to be ſent into the <hi>Valteline,</hi> ſhould have no exerciſe of their Religion, and as for other perſons, that none of the Religion might ſtay above ſix vveeks at a time in the Countrey. The
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60829:35"/> Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> ſeeing that conditions of ſo much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the Leagues vvere offered to them, did underhand adviſe thoſe of the Religion to accept of them, at the ſame time that he ſeemed openly to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the treaty ſet on foot on thoſe terms, and that he might get out of this imployment vvith the leſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, he adviſed their clapping him up in priſon till they had finiſhed their treaty vvith the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> So that they very gratefully to this day ovvn that they ovve the preſervation of their Countrey to the vviſe advices of that great Man. Many that vvere of the Religion returned to their Houſes and Eſtates, but the greateſt part fearing ſuch another Maſſacre, have ſince changed their Religion, others have ſold their Eſtates and left the Country, ſome ſtay ſtill and go tvvo or three hours journey to ſome of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> communities, vvhere they have the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the Religion: And tho they may not ſtay in the <hi>Valteline</hi> above ſix weeks at a time, yet they avoid that by going for a day or two out of the Countrey once within that time, nor is that matter at preſent ſo ſeverely examined, ſo that there is a calm among them as to thoſe matters. But when it comes to the turn of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> communities to ſend one of the Religion to thoſe imployments, he is often much em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baraſſed by the Biſhop of <hi>Como,</hi> to whoſe Dioceſs thoſe Territories belong, for if the Biſhop fancies that they do any thing contrary to the Eccleſiaſtical immunities, he excommunicates them, and tho this may appear a ridiculous thing, ſince they are already in a worſe ſtate by being Hereticks, yet it produces a very ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble effect, for the people that are extreamly ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, will not after that come near ſuch Magiſtrates, ſo that about three years ago a Bailiff found himſelf obliged to deſire to be recalled, tho his time was not out, ſince being excommunicated he could no longer maintain the Government in his own perſon,</p>

               <p>A Man that hath an Eſtate by his Wife, enjoys it after her Death as long as he continues a Widovver, but when he marries again he is bound to divide it among the Children that he had by her. The Juſtice is ſhort and ſimple; but it is oft thought that Bribes go here, tho' but meanly in proportion to their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, as well as in other Places. The married Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men here do ſcarce appear abroad except at Church, but the young Women have more Liberty before they are married. There is ſuch a plenty of all things, by reaſon of the gentleneſs of the Government and the induſtry of the People, that in all the ten days in which I ſtayed at <hi>Coire,</hi> I was but once ask'd an Alms in the Streets. There are two Churches in <hi>Coire,</hi> in the one there is an Organ that joyns with their Voices in the ſinging of the Pſalms; and there was for the honour of the Diet, while we were there, an Anthem ſung by a ſet of Muſicians very regularly. In all the Churches both of <hi>Switzerland</hi> and the <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> except in this only, the Miniſter preaches co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, but here he is bare-headed. And I obſerved a particular Devotion uſed here in ſaying of the Lord's Prayer, that the Miniſters who wear Caps put them off when it was ſaid. The Women here, as in <hi>Bern,</hi> turn all to the <hi>Eaſt</hi> in time of Prayer, and alſo in their private Devotions before and after the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayers: many alſo bow at the Name of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> They <hi>Chriſten</hi> diſcovering the whole Head, and pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Water on the hind-head, uſing a trine Aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which is alſo the practice of the <hi>Switzers.</hi> It vvas matter of much Edification, to ſee the great Numbers both here and all <hi>Switzerland</hi> over, that come every day to Prayers morning and evening.

The Liquor being ſingular, I informed my ſelf particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of the way of preparing it: the Grapes are red, tho it drinks white; they let the Grapes hang on the Vines till <hi>November</hi> that they are extream ripe, then they carry them to their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets, and ſet them all upright on their ends by one another for two or three months, then they pick all the Grapes and throw away thoſe in which there is the leaſt appearance of rottenneſs, ſo that they preſs none but ſound Grapes: after they are preſſed they put the Liquor in an open Veſſel, in which it throws up a ſcum, which they take off twice a day, and when no more ſcum comes up, which according to the difference of the ſeaſon is ſooner or later, for ſometimes the ſcum comes no more after eight days, and at other times it continues a Fortnight, then they put it in a cloſe Veſſel; for the firſt year it is extream ſweet and luſcious, but at the end of the year they pierce it a little higher then the middle of the Veſſel, almoſt two thirds from the bottom, and drink it off till it cometh ſo low, and then every year they fill it up a new: once a year in the month of <hi>March</hi> it ferments, and cannot be drunk till that is over, which continues a month, but their other Wine ferments not at that time. <hi>Madam Salis</hi> a
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60829:41"/> Lady of that Country who entertained us three days with a magnificence equal to what can be done in <hi>London</hi> or <hi>Paris,</hi> had Wine of this compoſition that was forty years old, and was ſo very ſtrong that one could hardly drink above a ſpoonful, and it taſted high of Spicery, tho ſhe aſſured me there was not one grain of Spice in it, nor of any other mixture whatſoever. Thus the heat that is in this Wine, becomes a fire and diſtils it ſelf, throwing up the more ſpirituous parts of it to the top of the Hogs-Head.</p>

They live in a great ſimplicity as to their habit and furniture, but they have plenty of all things, and are extream Rich, the Family where we were ſo Nobly Entertained is believed to have about two hundred thouſand Crowns: here the <hi>Italian</hi> cuſtom of one only of a Family that Marries takes place generally. There is a ſort of Pots of Stone that is uſed not only in all the Kitchins here, but almoſt all <hi>Lombardy</hi> over, called <hi>Lavege,</hi> the Stone feels oyly and ſcaly, ſo that a ſcale ſticks to ones Finger that touches it, and is ſomewhat of the nature of a ſlate, there are but three Mines of it known in theſe parts, one near <hi>Chavennes,</hi> another in the <hi>Valteline,</hi> and the third in the <hi>Griſons,</hi> but the firſt is much the beſt, they generally cut it in the Mine round, of about a foot and a half Diameter, and about a foot and a quarter thick, and they work it in a Mill, where the Chizzels that cut the Stone are driven about by a Wheel that is ſet a going by VVater, and which is ſo ordered that he who man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages the Chizzel, very eaſily draws forward the VVheel out of the courſe of the VVater; they turn off firſt the outward Coat of this Stone till it is
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60829:41"/> exactly ſmooth, and then they ſeparate one Pot after another by thoſe ſmall and hooked Chizzels, by which they make a neſt of Pots all one within another, the outward and biggeſt being as big as an ordinary Beef-pot, and the inward Pot being no bigger than a ſmall Pipkin; theſe they arm with hooks and circles of Braſs, and ſo they are ſerved by them in their Kitchins. One of theſe Stone-pots takes heat and boils ſooner than any Pot of Mettle; and whereas the bottoms of Mettle-pots tranſmit the heat ſo intirely to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor within, that they are not inſufferably hot, the bottom of this Stone-pot, which is about twice ſo thick as a Pot of Mettle, burns extreamly; it never cracks, neither gives it any ſort of taſte to the Liquor that is boiled in it, but if it falls to the ground it is very brittle, yet this is repaired by p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>But having mentioned ſome falls of Mountains in thoſe parts, I cannot paſs by the extraordinary fate of the Town of <hi>Pleurs,</hi> that was about a league from <hi>Chavennes</hi> to the North in the ſame bottom, but on a ground that is a little more raiſed: The Town was half the bigneſs of <hi>Chavenneſs,</hi> the number of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants was about two and twenty hundred p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

By one of the Palaces that was a little diſtant from the Town, which was not overwhelmed with it, one may judge of the reſt: It was an out-houſe of the Family of the <hi>Francken,</hi> and yet it may compare with many Palaces in <hi>Italy,</hi> and certainly Houſe and Gardens could not coſt ſo little as one hundred thouſand Crowns.

Some of the Family of the <hi>Francken</hi> got ſome Miners to work un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ground, to find out the wealth that was buried in their Palace; for beſides their Plate and Furniture there was a great caſh and many Jewels in the Houſe: the Miners pretended they could find nothing, but they went to their Countrey of <hi>Tirol,</hi> and built fine Houſes and a great wealth appeared, of which no other viſible account could be given but this, that they had found ſome of that treaſure.

                  </gap>re I muſt tell you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Paradox, this is the worſt Countrey, the leaſt Productive, the moſt expoſed to cold, and the leaſt capable of Trade of all <hi>Italy,</hi> and yet is by far the beſt peopled of any that I ſaw in all <hi>Italy:</hi> There belongs to the Baliage of <hi>Lugane</hi> alone ninety nine Villages, of which a great many are very large, and all are full of people. The twelve ancient Cantons have their turns of all the Baliages and other Officers here: but when it comes to the turn of thoſe of the Religion, their Bayliffs muſt be contented with private Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in their own Houſe, but can have no publick exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60829:43"/> nor ſo much as a Miniſter in their Houſes. For here as in the <hi>Valteline</hi> when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> confirmed the right of the Cantons to thoſe Territories, they made an expreſs proviſion, that no Religion except the <hi>Popiſh</hi> ſhould be tolerated here; ſo that the Bayliff who is the Prince often hath not the free Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of his Religion in theſe parts. The Bayliffs here make their advantages as well as in the other parts of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> but yet with more caution, for they take great care not to give the natives any diſtaſt, tho the miſeries to which they ſee all their Neighbours expoſed, and the abundance and liberty in which they live ſhould by all appearance deliver their Maſters from any great apprehenſions of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt: A geeat many Mechanicks of all ſorts live in theſe parts, who go all Summer long over <hi>Italy,</hi> and come back hither with what they have gained, and live free of all Taxes.</p>
               <p>I was told that ſome Nephews of <hi>Popes,</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular the <hi>Barberines</hi> had Treated with the <hi>Switzers</hi> to buy this Country from them, and ſo to erect it into a principality, and that they had reſolved to offer twelve thouſand Crowns to the twelve Cantons, but they found it would certainly be rejected, ſo they made not the propoſition to the Diet of the Cantons as they once intended, and it is certain whenſoever this Country is brought under a yoke like that which the reſt of <hi>Italy</hi> bears it will be ſoon abandoned, for there is nothing that draws ſo many people to live in ſo ill a ſoil, when they are in ſight of the beſt ſoil of <hi>Europe,</hi> but the eaſineſs of the Government. From <hi>Lugane</hi> I went to the <hi>Lago Maggiore,</hi> which is a great and Noble Lake, it is ſix and fifty miles long, and in moſt places ſix miles broad, and a Hundred Fathom deep about the middle of it, it makes a great Bay to the VVeſtward, and their lies here two Iſlands called the <hi>Borromean</hi>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:60829:44"/> Iſlands, that are certainly the lovelieſt ſpots of ground in the VVorld, there is nothing in all <hi>Italy</hi> that can be compared to them, they have the full view of the Lake, and the ground riſes ſo ſweetly in them that nothing can be imagined like the Terraſſes here, they belong to two Counts of the <hi>Borromean</hi> Family. I was only in one of them which belongs to the head of the Family, who is Nephew to the Famous <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal</hi> known by the name of <hi>S. Carlo:</hi> on the VVeſt-end lies the Palace, which is one of the beſt of <hi>Italy,</hi> for the lodgings within, tho the Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture is but ordinary, there is one Noble apartment above four and twenty foot high, and there is a vaſt addition making to it, and here is a great Collection of Noble Pictures beyond any thing I ſaw out of <hi>Rome:</hi> The whole Iſland is a Garden except a little corner to the <hi>South</hi> ſet off for a Village of about forty little Houſes, and becauſe the figure of the Iſland was not made regular by nature, they have built great Vaults and <hi>Portaca's</hi> along the Rock, which are all made Groteſque, and ſo they have brought it to a regular form by laying Earth over thoſe Vaults. There is firſt a Garden to the <hi>Eaſt</hi> that riſes up from the Lake by five rows of <hi>Terraſſes,</hi> on the three ſides of the Garden that are watered by the Lake, the Stairs are Noble, the VValls are all covered with Oranges and Citrons, and a more beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſpot of a Garden cannot be ſeen: There are two buildings in the two corners of this Garden, the one is only a milne for fetching up the VVater, and the other is a noble Summer-houſe all wainſcotted, if I may ſpeak ſo, with Alabaſter and Marble of a fine colour inclining to red, from this Garden one goes in a level to all the reſt of the Allies and parterres, Herb-Gardens and Flower-Gardens, in all which there are varieties of Fountains and Arbors, but the great par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre is a ſurprizing thing, for as it is well furniſhed
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60829:44"/> with Statues and Fountains, and is of a vaſt extent, and juſtly ſcituated to the Palace, ſo at the further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end of it there is a great Mount, that face of it that looks to the Parterre is made like a Theater all full of Fountains and Statues, the height riſing up in five ſeveral rows, it being about Fifty foot high, and about Fourſcore foot in front, and round this Mount anſwering to the Five rows into which the Theater is divided, there goes as many terraſſes of noble walks, the Walls are all as cloſe covered with Oranges and Citrons as any of our Walls in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> are with Lawrel; the top of the Mount is Seventy foot long and Forty broad, and here is a vaſt Ciſtern into which the Mill plays up the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that muſt furniſh all the Fountains: The Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains were not quite finiſhed when I was there, but when all is finiſhed this place will look like an Inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Iſland. The freſhneſs of the Air, it being both in a Lake and near the Mountains, the fragrant ſmell, the beautiful proſpect, and the delighting variety that is here makes it ſuch a habitation for Summer, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the whole World hath nothing like it. From this I went to <hi>Seſtio,</hi> a miſerable Village at the end of the Lake, and here I began to feel a mighty change being now in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> which is certainly the beautifulleſt Country that can be imagined, the ground lies ſo even, it is ſo well watered, ſo ſweetly divided by rows of Trees incloſing every piece of ground of an Acre or two Acres compaſs, that it cannot be denied that here is a vaſt extent of ſoil above Two Hundred miles long, and in many places a Hundred-miles broad, where the whole Country is equal to the lovelieſt ſpots in all <hi>England</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> it hath all the ſweetneſs that <hi>Holland</hi> or <hi>Flanders</hi> have, but with a warmer Sun and a better Air, the Neighbour-hood of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains cauſes a freſhneſs of Air here, that makes the ſoil the moſt deſirable place to live in that can be ſeen, if the Government were not ſo exceſſively ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60829:45"/> that there is nothing but poverty over all this rich Country. A Traveller in many places finds al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt nothing, and is ſo ill furniſhed, that if he doth not buy proviſions in the great Towns, he will be obliged to a very ſevere Diet, in a Country that he ſhould think flowed with Milk and Honey; but I ſhall ſay more of this hereafter. The <hi>Lago Maggio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi> diſcharges it ſelf in the River <hi>Teſine,</hi> which runs with ſuch a force that we went Thirty miles in three hours, having but one Rower, and the Water was no way ſwelled. From this we went into the <hi>Canale,</hi> which <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt cut from this River to the Town of <hi>Milan,</hi> which is about Thirty foot broad, and on both its banks there are ſuch proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to diſcharge the Water when it riſes, to ſuch a height, that it can never be fuller of Water then is intended it ſhould be; it lies alſo ſo even that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for ſix miles together one ſees the line ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act that there is not the leaſt crook; it is Thirty miles long, and is the beſt advantage that the Town of <hi>Milan</hi> hath for Water carriage.</p>
               <p>I will not entertain you with a long deſcription of this great City, which is one of the nobleſt in the World, to be an Inland Town that hath no great Court, no commerce either by Sea or any Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble River, and that is now the Metropolis of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmall State; for that which is not Mountainous in this ſtate, is not above ſixty miles ſquare, and yet it produces a wealth that is ſurprizing: It paies for an eſtabliſhment of Seven and Forty Thouſand Men, and yet there are not Sixteen Thouſand Souldiers effectively in it, ſo many are eat up by thoſe in whoſe hands the Government is lodged: But the vaſtneſs of the Town, the Nobleneſs of the Buildings, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all the ſurprizing riches of the Churches and Convents are ſigns of great wealth: The Dome hath nothing to commend it of Architecture, it being built in the rude <hi>Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60829:45"/> and riches of the Building, it is equal to any in <hi>Italy,</hi> S. <hi>Peters</hi> it ſelf not excepted. It is all marble, both pavement, and Walls both outſide and inſide, and on the top it is all flagg'd with Marble; and there is the vaſteſt number of niches for Statues of Marble, both within and without, that are any where to be ſeen. It is true the Statues in ſome of the ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are not proportioned to the niches themſelves; the Frontiſpiece is not yet made, it is to be all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver covered with Statues and <hi>bas reliefs;</hi> and the Pillars of which there are Four rows in the body of the Church, have each of them Eight niches at the top for ſo many Statues; and though one would think this Church ſo full of Statues, that almoſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Saint hath his ſtatue, yet I was aſſured they wanted Seven Thouſand to finiſh the deſign, but theſe muſt chiefly belong to the Frontiſpiece: The Church as I could meaſure it by walking over it in an equal pace, is Five Hundred foot long, and Two Hundred wide; the Quire is wainſchotted and cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſo extraordinary a manner, that I never ſaw Paſſion ſo well expreſſed in Wood; it contains Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſtalls, and they have almoſt all the Hiſtories of the Goſpel repreſented in them. Juſt under the Cupulo lies S. <hi>Carlo</hi>'s body, as I was told, in a great caſe of Criſtal of vaſt value, but I could not come near it; for we were there on two Holy-days, and there was a perpetual crowd about it; and the ſuperſtition of the People for his body, is ſuch, that on a Holy-day one runs a hazard that comes near it without doing ſome reverence. His Canonization coſt the Town a Hundred Thouſand Crowns, they pretend they have miracles too, for Cardinal <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derigo Borromee;</hi> but they will not ſet about his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonization, the price is ſo high. The Plate and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preſents made to S. <hi>Carlo</hi> are things of a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious value; ſome ſervices for the Altar are all of Gold, ſome very maſſie and ſet with Jewels, others
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60829:46"/> ſo finely wrought that the faſhion is thought equal to the value of the mettle; the Habits and all the other Ornaments for the Function of his Canoniza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are all of an incredible Wealth. He was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a Prelate of great merit, and according to the anſwer that a Frier made to <hi>Philip de Comines,</hi> when he asked him how they came to qualifie one of the worſt of their Princes with the Title of Saint in an Inſcription which he read, which was that they gave that Title to all their Benefactors; never Man deſerved of a Town this Title ſo juſtly as Cardinal <hi>Borromee</hi> did, for he laid out a prodigious Wealth in <hi>Milan,</hi> leaving nothing to his Family, but the honour of having produced ſo great a Man, which is a real temporal Inheritance to it, for as there have been, ſince that time, two Cardinals of that Family, ſo it is eſteemed a <hi>Caſa Santa;</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very time that it produces an Eccleſiaſtick of any conſiderable merit, he is ſure, if he lives to it, to be raiſed to this Arch-biſhoprick, for if there were one of the Family capable of it, and that did not carry it that alone might diſpoſe the State to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and he were a bold Man that would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture on a competition with one of this Family. He laid out a great deal on the Dome and conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, though the work will not be quite finiſhed yet for ſome Ages, that being one of the crafts of the <hi>Italian</hi> Prieſts never to finiſh a great deſign, that ſo by keeping it ſtill in an unfiniſht eſtate, they may be always drawing great donatives to it, from the ſuperſtition of the People. He built the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Palace, which is very noble, and a ſeminary, a Colledge for the <hi>Switzers,</hi> ſeveral Pariſh Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and many Convents. In ſhort the whole Town is full of the marks of his Wealth. The riches of the Churches of <hi>Milan</hi> ſtrike one with amazement, the Building, the Painting, the Altars, and the Plate, and every thing in the Convents, except their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braires,

The Convent of S. <hi>Victor</hi> that is without the Town, is by much the richeſt, it is compoſed of Canons Regular, called in <hi>Italy</hi> the Order of <hi>Mount Olive,</hi> or <hi>Olivetan,</hi> that of the <hi>Bernabites</hi> is extream rich, there is a Pulpit and a Confeſſional all inlaid with Agates of different co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, finely ſpotted Marbles, and of <hi>Lapis Lazulis</hi> that are thought almoſt ineſtimable.

The Cittadel is too well known to need a deſcription, it is very regularly built, and is a moſt effectual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint to keep the Town in order, but it could not ſtand out againſt a good Army three days; for it is ſo little, and ſo f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Hoſpital is indeed a Royal Building, I was told it had Ninety Thouſand Crowns Revenue: The old Court is large, and would look noble if it were not for the new Court that is near it, which is Two Hundred and Fifty foot ſquare, and there are three rows of Corridors or Galleries all round the Court, one in every ſtage ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Italian</hi> manner, which makes the lodgings very convenient, and gives a Gallery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every door: It is true theſe take up a great deal of the Building, being ordinarily Eight or Ten foot broad; but then here is an open ſpace that is extream cool on that ſide where the Sun doth not lie, for it is all open to the Air, the Wall being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupported by Pillars, at the diſtance of Fifteen or
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60829:47"/> Twenty foot one from another. In this Hoſpital there are not only Galleries full of Beds on both ſides, as is ordinary in all Hoſpitals; but there are alſo a great many Chambers in which Perſons whoſe condition was formerly diſtinguiſhed are treated with a particular care. There is an out-houſe which is called the <hi>Lazarette,</hi> that is without the Walls, which belongs to this Hoſpital, it is an exact quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a mile ſquare, and there are Three Hundred and Sixty Rooms in it, and a Gallery runs all along before the Chambers, ſo that as the ſervice is conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, the ſick have a covered walk before their Doors. In the middle of this vaſt ſquare there is an <hi>Octangular</hi> Chappel, ſo contrived that the ſick from all their Beds may ſee the elevation of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie and adore it: This Houſe is for the Plague or for infectious Feavers, and the Sick that want a freer Air, are alſo removed hither.</p>
               <p>As for the devotions of this place, I ſaw here the <hi>Ambroſian</hi> Office, which is diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> both in the Muſick which is much ſimpler, and in ſome other rites: the Goſpel is read in a high Pulpit at the lower end of the Quire, that ſo it may be heard by all the People, though this is needleſs, ſince it is read in a Language that they do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand; when they go to ſay high Maſs, the Prieſts comes from the high Altar to the lower-end of the Quire, where the Offertory of the Bread and the Wine is made by ſome of the Laity, they were Nuns that made it when I was there, I heard a <hi>Capucin</hi> Preach here; it was the firſt Sermon I heard in <hi>Italy,</hi> and I was much ſurprized at many Comical expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and geſtures, but moſt of all with the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for there being in all the Pulpits of <hi>Italy</hi> a Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix on the ſide of the Pulpit towards the Altar; he, after a long addreſs to it, at laſt in a forced tranſport, took it in his Arms and hugged it and kiſſed it: But I obſerved that before he kiſs'd it; he ſeeing ſome duſt
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60829:47"/> on it, blew it off very carefully, for I was juſt under the Pulpit: He entertained it with a long and tender careſs, and held it out to the People, and would have forced tears both from himſelf and them, yet I ſaw none ſhed. But if the Sermon in the Morning ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized me, I wondred no leſs at two diſcourſes that I heard in one Church, at the ſame time, in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon; for there were two bodies of Men ſet down in different places of the Church all covered, and two Lay-men in ordinary habits were entertaining them with diſcourſes of Religion in a Catechetical ſtile: Theſe were Confrairies, and thoſe were ſome of the more devout that inſtructed the reſt. This I never ſaw any where elſe, ſo I do not know whether it is peculiar to <hi>Milan</hi> or not. My Conductor could not ſpeak <hi>Latin,</hi> and the <hi>Italian</hi> there is ſo different from the true <hi>Tuſcan,</hi> which I only knew, that I could not underſtand him when he was engaged in a long diſcourſe, ſo I was not clearly informed of this matter; but I am apt to think it might have been ſome inſtitution of Cardinal <hi>Borromees.</hi> The <hi>Ambro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Library founded by Cardinal <hi>Frederick Borromee</hi> is a very noble Room and well furniſhed, only it is too full of School-men and Canoniſts, which are the chief ſtudies of <hi>Italy,</hi> and it hath too few Books of a more ſolid and uſeful learning. One part of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Room was pleaſant, there is a great number of Chairs placed all round it at a competent diſtance from one another, and to every Chair there belongs a Desk with an Ecritoire that hath Pen, Ink, and Paper in it, ſo that every Man finds tools here for ſuch extracts as he would make. There is a little Room of Manuſcripts at the end of the great Gallery, but the Library-keeper knows little of them, a great many of them relate to their Saint <hi>Charles.</hi> I ſaw ſome fragments of <hi>Latin</hi> Bibles, but none ſeemed to be above Six Hundred Years old, there are alſo ſome fragments of Saint <hi>Ambroſes</hi> works, and of Saint <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi>'s
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60829:48"/> Epiſtle that are of the ſame antiquity. I was ſorry not to find St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi>'s Works intire, that I might have ſeen whether the Books of the Sacraments are aſcribed to him in ancient Copies, for perhaps they belong to a more modern Author.</p>
               <p>It is true, in theſe Books the Doctrine of a ſort of a Corporal Preſence is aſſerted in very high expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; but there is one thing mentioned in them, which is ſtronger againſt it than all thoſe citations can be for it; for the Author gives us the formal words of the Prayer of Conſecration in his time, which he Prefaces with ſolemnity: Will you know how the change is wrought, hear the Heavenly words? For the Prieſt ſaith, but whereas in the preſent Canon of the Maſs, the Prayer of Conſecration is for a good part of it very near in the ſame words with thoſe which he mentions, there is one eſſential difference, for in the Canon they now pray that the Hoſty may be to them the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> (which by the way doth not agree too well with the notion of Tranſubſtantiation, and approacheth more to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Lutherians:</hi>) whereas in the Prayer, cited by that Author, the Hoſty is ſaid to be the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> here is the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the whole Church of that time, and in the moſt important part of the divine Office, which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth more to me than a Thouſand Quotations out of particular Writers, which are but their private opinions: But this is the voice of the whole body in its addreſſes to God: And it ſeems the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> when the new Doctrine of the Corporal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence was received, ſaw that this Prayer of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration could not conſiſt with it, which made her change ſuch a main part of the Office. This gave me a curioſity every where to ſearch for ancient Offices, but I ſound none in the Abbey of St. <hi>Germains</hi> that ſeemed older than the times of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great; ſo I found none of any great Antiquity in all <hi>Italy:</hi>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:60829:48"/> Thoſe publiſhed by Cardinal <hi>Bona,</hi> and ſince by <hi>P. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>billon,</hi> that were brought from <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> are the moſt ancient that are in the <hi>Vatican;</hi> but theſe ſeem not to be above Eight hundred Years old: There are none of the ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Offices now to be ſeen in the <hi>Vatican.</hi> I was amazed to find none of any great Antiquity; which made me conclude that either they were deſtroyed, that ſo the difference between Ancient and Modern Rituals might not be turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that Church, as an undeniable Evidence to prove the Changes that ſhe hath made in divine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or that they were ſo well kept that Hereticks were not to be ſuffered to look into them. But to return to the <hi>Ambroſian</hi> Library, there is in it a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript of great Antiquity, though not of ſuch great conſequence, which is <hi>Ruffinus</hi>'s Tranſlation of <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi> that is written in the old <hi>Roman</hi> hand, which is very hard to read. But there is a deed in the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Collection that Count <hi>Maſcardo</hi> hath made at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona,</hi> which by the date appears to have been written in <hi>Theodoſius</hi>'s time, which is the ſame ſort of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the Manuſcript of <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> ſo that it may be reckoned to have been writ in <hi>Ruffinus</hi>'s own time, and this is the moſt valuable, though the leaſt known curioſity in the whole Library.</p>
               <p>I need not ſay any thing of the curious Works in Cryſtal that are to be ſeen in <hi>Milan;</hi> the greateſt quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities that are in <hi>Europe,</hi> are found in the <hi>Alps;</hi> and are wrought here; but this is too well known to need any further enlargement. It is certain, the <hi>Alps</hi> have much Wealth ſhut up in their Rocks, if the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants knew how to ſearch for it: But I heard of no Mines that were wrought except Iron Mines; yet by the colourings, that in many places, the Fountains make, as they run along the Rocks, one ſees cauſe to believe that there are Mines and Minerals ſhut up within them. Gold hath been often found in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Arve,</hi> that runs by <hi>Geneva.</hi>

               <p>The laſt Curioſity that I ſhall mention of the Town of <hi>Milan,</hi> is the Cabinet of the Chanoine <hi>Settala,</hi> which is now in his Brothers hands, where there are a great many very valuable things, both of Art and Nature: there is a lump of Ore, in which there is both Gold, Silver, Emeralds, and Diamonds, which was brought from <hi>Peru.</hi> There are many curious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions where by an unſeen Spring, a Ball, after it hath rowled down through many winding deſcents, is thrown up, and ſo it ſeems to be a perpetual motion; This is done in ſeveral forms, and is well enough diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed to deceive the vulgar. Many motions of little Animals that run about by Springs, are alſo very pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. There is a Loadſtone of a vaſt force that carries a great Chain: There is alſo a monſtrous Child that was lately born in the Hoſpital, which is preſerved in Spirit of Wine: It is double below, it hath one Breaſt and Neck, two pair of Ears, a vaſt Head, and but one Face. As for the Buildings in <hi>Milan,</hi> they are big and ſubſtantial, but they have not much regular or beautiful Architecture: The Governors Palace hath ſome noble apartments in it: The chief Place of the Town is that of the <hi>Homodei,</hi> which was built by a Bankier. There is one inconvenience in <hi>Milan,</hi> which throws down all the pleaſure that one can find in it: they have no Glaſs Windows, ſo that one is either expoſed to the Air, or ſhut up in a Dungeon: and this ſo univerſal, that there is not one houſe of ten that hath Glaſs in their Windows: The ſame defect is in <hi>Florence,</hi> beſides all the ſmall Towns of <hi>Italy,</hi> which is an effect of their poverty: For what by the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Government, what by the no leſs ſqueezing oppreſſion of their Prieſts, who drain all the reſt of their Wealth that is not eat up by the Prince, to inrich their Churches and Convents, the People here are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a poverty, that cannot be eaſily believed by one that ſees the Wealth that is in their Churches, and this is going on ſo conſtantly in <hi>Milan,</hi> that it is
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60829:49"/> ſcarce accountable from whence ſo vaſt a treaſure can be found; but Purgatory is a fond not eaſily exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Wealth of the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> conſiſts chiefly in their Silks, and that Trade falls ſo mightily by the vaſt Importations that the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Companies bring into <hi>Europe,</hi> that all <hi>Italy</hi> feels this very ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and languiſhes extreamly by the great fall that is in the Silk-Trade: There is a great magnificence in <hi>Milan;</hi> the Nobility affect to make a noble appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance both in their Cloaths, their Coaches, and their Attendants; and the Women go abroad with more freedom here than in any Town of <hi>Italy.</hi> And thus I have told you all that hath hitherto occurred to me, that I thought worth your knowledge.

                  <p>IN the account that I gave you of <hi>Geneva,</hi> I forgot to mention a very extraordinary Perſon that is there, Mrs. <hi>Walkier;</hi> her Father is of <hi>Shaff</hi> Houſe, ſhe loſt her ſight when ſhe was but a Year old, by being too near a Stove that was very hot: There reſts in her Eye ſo much ſight, that ſhe diſtinguiſhes Day from Night; and when any Perſon ſtands between her and the light ſhe will diſtinguiſh by the Head and its dreſs a Man from a Woman; but when ſhe turns down her Eyes ſhe ſees nothing: ſhe hath a vaſt memory; beſides the <hi>French</hi> that is her natural language, ſhe ſpeakes both <hi>High Dutch, Italian</hi> and <hi>Latine:</hi> ſhe hath all the Pſalms by heart, in <hi>French,</hi> and many of them in <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Italian:</hi> the underſtands the Old Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy well, and is now ſtudying the New: ſhe hath ſtudied the body of Divinity well, and hath the Text of the Scriptures very ready: On all which matters I had long converſations with her; ſhe not only ſings well, but ſhe plays rarely on the Organ; and I was told ſhe played on the Violin, but her Violin was out of order. But that which is moſt of all, is, ſhe writes legibly: in order to her learning to write, her Father
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60829:50"/> who is a worthy Man, and hath ſuch tenderneſs for her, that he furniſheth her with Maſters of all ſorts, ordered Letters to be carved in Wood, and ſhe by feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Characters formed ſuch an Idea of them, that ſhe writes with a Crayon ſo diſtinctly, that her wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting can be well read, of which I have ſeveral Eſſays. I ſaw her write, ſhe doth it more nimbly than can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined; ſhe hath a Machine that holds the Paper, and keeps her always in line. But that which is above all the reſt, ſhe is a perſon of extraordinary Devotion, great reſignation to the Will of God, and a profound humility: The Preceptor that the Father kept in the houſe with her, hath likewiſe a wonderful faculty of acquiring Tongues. When he came firſt to <hi>Geneva,</hi> (for he is of <hi>Zurich</hi>) he ſpoke not a word of <hi>French,</hi> and within Thirteen months he Preacht in <hi>French</hi> correctly, and with a good accent: He alſo began to ſtudy <hi>Italian</hi> in the month of <hi>November,</hi> and before the end of the following <hi>February</hi> he preacht in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian;</hi> his accent was good, and his ſtile was florid, which was very extraordinary, for the <hi>Italian</hi> langu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age is not ſpoken in <hi>Geneva,</hi> though the Race of the <hi>Italians</hi> do keep up ſtill an <hi>Italian</hi> Church there.</p>

               <head>THE THIRD LETTER. Florence <hi>the</hi> 5th. <hi>of</hi> November.</head>
               <p>I Have now another Month over my head ſince I writ laſt to you, and ſo I know you expect an account of the moſt conſiderable things that have occurred to me ſince my laſt from <hi>Milan.</hi> Twenty miles from <hi>Milan</hi> we paſt through <hi>Lodi</hi> a miſerable Garriſon, though a Frontier Town; but indeed the Frontiers, both of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> as well as thoſe of other Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> ſhew that they are not very apprehenſive of one another; and when one paſſes through thoſe places, which are repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Hiſtory as places of great ſtrength, capable of reſiſting a long Siege, he muſt acknowledge that the ſight of them, brings the <hi>Idea</hi> that he had conceived of them, a great many degrees lower. For <hi>Lombardy,</hi> which was ſo long the ſeat of War, could not ſtand out a good Army now for ſo many Days, as it did then for Years. The Garriſon of <hi>Crema,</hi> which is the firſt of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Territory, is no better than that of <hi>Lodi,</hi> only the People in the <hi>Venetian</hi> Dominion live happier than under the <hi>Spaniard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Senate ſends <hi>Podeſta</hi>'s, much like the Bailifs of the <hi>Switzers,</hi> who order the Juſtice and the Civil Government of the Juriſdiction aſſigned them: There is alſo a Captain General who hath the Military Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in his hands; and theſe two are checks upon one another, as the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s and the <hi>Cadi</hi>'s are among the <hi>Turks.</hi> But here in <hi>Crema</hi> the Town is ſo ſmall
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60829:51"/> that both theſe are in one Perſon. We were there in the time of the Fair, Linnen Cloath and Cheeſe, which though it goes by the name of <hi>Parmeſan,</hi> is made chiefly in <hi>Lodi,</hi> are the main Ingredients of the Fair. The magnificence of the <hi>Podeſta</hi> appeared very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, for he went through the Fair with a great train of Coaches, all in his own Livery; and the two Coaches in which he and his Lady ride, were both extraordinary rich: his was a huge Bed-coach, all the out ſide black Velvet, and a mighty rich Gold fringe, lined with black Damask, flowred with Gold. From <hi>Crema</hi> it is Thirty miles to <hi>Breſcia,</hi> which is a great Town, and full of Trade and Wealth, here they make the beſt Barrils for Piſtols and Muskets of all <hi>Italy:</hi> There are great Iron Works near it; but the War with the <hi>Turk</hi> had occaſioned an Order that none be ſold without a permiſſion from <hi>Venice:</hi> They are building a Noble Dome at <hi>Breſcia:</hi> I was ſhewed a Nunnery there, which is now under a great diſgrace, ſome years ago a new Biſhop coming thither, began with the Viſitation of that Nunnery: he diſcovered two Vaults, by one, Men came ordinarily into it: and by another the Nuns that were big went and lay-in of Child-bed: when he was examining the Nuns ſeverely concerning thoſe Vaults, ſome of them told him, that his own Prieſts did much worſe: He ſhut up the Nuns, ſo that thoſe who are profeſſed live ſtill there, but none come to take the Vail: and by this means the Houſe will ſoon come to an end: The Cittadel lies over the Town on a Rock, and commands it abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely. Both here and in <hi>Crema</hi> the Towns have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun a Complement within theſe laſt Ten or Twelve Years to their <hi>Podeſta</hi>'s, which is a matter of great Ornament to their Palaces, but will grow to a vaſt charge, for they erect Statues to their <hi>Podeſta</hi>'s: and this being once begun, muſt be carried on: otherwiſe thoſe, to whom the like Honour is not done, will reſent it as a high affront, and the revenges of the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60829:51"/> Noble <hi>Venetians,</hi> are dreadful things their to Subjects. This name of <hi>Podeſta</hi> is very ancient, for in the Roman times, the chief Magiſtrates of the leſſer Towns was called the <hi>Poteſtas,</hi> as appears by that of <hi>Juveral-Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narum Gabiorumve eſſe poteſtas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From <hi>Breſcia</hi> the beauty of <hi>Lombardy</hi> is a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted; for as all the way from <hi>Milan</hi> to <hi>Breſcia</hi> is as one Garden, ſo here on the one ſide we come under the Mountains, and we paſs by the Lake of <hi>Guarda,</hi> which is Forty miles long, and where it is broadeſt, is Twenty miles broad: The miles indeed, all <hi>Lombardy</hi> over, are extream ſhort, for I walkt often four or five miles in a walk, and I found a Thouſand paces made their common mile; but in <hi>Tuſcany</hi> and the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> the mile is Fifteen Hundred pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. We paſs through a great Heath for Seven or Eight miles on this ſide of <hi>Verona,</hi> which begins to be cultivated. <hi>Verona</hi> is a vaſt Town, and much of it well built; there are many rich Churches in it; but there is ſo little Trade ſtirring, and ſo little money going, that it is not eaſie here to change a Piſtol, without taking their coin of baſe alloy, which doth not paſs out of the <hi>Veroneſe;</hi> for this ſeems a ſtrange maxim of the <hi>Venetians</hi> to ſuffer thoſe ſmall ſtates, to retain ſtill a coin peculiar to them, which is extream inconvenient for Commerce. The known Antiquity of <hi>Verona</hi> is the Amphitheater, one of the leaſt of all that the <hi>Romans</hi> built, but the beſt preſerved, for though moſt of the great ſtones of the out-ſide are pickt out; yet the great flopping Vault on which the rows of the ſeats are alſo intire, they are four and forty rows, every row is a foot and half high, and as much in breadth, ſo that a Man ſits conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently in them, under the feet of thoſe of the higher row: and allowing every Man a foot and a half, the whole Amphitheater can hold Twenty three thouſand perſons. In the Vaults, under the rows of ſeats, were the Stalls for the Beaſts that were preſented to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60829:52"/> the Company: the thickneſs of the building, from the outward Wall to the loweſt row of ſeats, is ninety foot: But this Noble remnant of Antiquity is ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and ſo copiouſly deſcribed, that I will ſay no more of it. The next thing of value is the famous <hi>Muſeum Calceolarium,</hi> now in the hands of the Count <hi>Maſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> where there is a whole apartment of Rooms all furniſht with Antiquities and Rarities: There are ſome old Inſcriptions made by two Towns in <hi>Africk,</hi> to the Honour of <hi>M. Craſſus:</hi> There is a great collection of Medals and Medaillons, and of the <hi>Roman</hi> Weights, and their Inſtruments for their Sacrifices, there are many Curioſities of Nature, and a great collection of Pictures, of which many are of <hi>Paulo Veroneſe</hi>'s hand. There is a noble Garden in <hi>Verona</hi> that riſeth up in Terraſſes the whole heigth of a Hill, in which there are many ancient Inſcriptions, which belongs to Count <hi>Giuſto.</hi> As we go from <hi>Verona</hi> to <hi>Vincenza</hi> which is thirty miles, we return to the beauty of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> for there is all the way as it were a ſucceſſion of Gardens, the Ground is better cultivated here than I ſaw it in any other place of <hi>Italy:</hi> But the Wine is not good, for at the roots of all their Trees they plant a Vine which grows up winding about the Tree to which it joins; but the Soil is too rich to produce a rich Wine, for that requires a dry ground: There is near the Lake of <hi>Guarda</hi> a very extraordinary Wine which they call <hi>Vino Santo,</hi> which drinks like the beſt ſort of <hi>Canary,</hi> it is not made till <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> and from thence it carries the name of <hi>Holy Wine,</hi> and it is not to be drunk till Midſummer, for it is ſo long before it is quite wrought clear, but I have not marked down how long it may be kept: We had it there for a groat an <hi>Engliſh</hi> quart, I wondred that they did not Trade with it. All the Cattle of <hi>Italy</hi> are gray or white, and all their Hogs are black, except in the <hi>Bologneſe,</hi> and there they are red. I will not inquire into the reaſons of theſe things: It is certain Hogs-Fleſh
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60829:52"/> in <hi>Italy</hi> is much better than it is in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> whether the truffs on which they feed much in Winter, occaſion this or not, I know not, the husks of the preſſed Grapes is alſo a mighty nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them; but Cattel of that grayiſh colour are certainly weaker: The carriage of <hi>Italy</hi> is generally performed by them, and this is very hard work in <hi>Lombardy</hi> when it hath rained never ſo little, for the ground being quite level, and there being no raiſed High-ways or Cauſe-ways, the Carts go deep and are hardly drawn.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vincenza</hi> hath ſtill more of its ancient liberty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved than any of theſe Towns, as <hi>Padua</hi> hath leſs, for it delivered it ſelf to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> whereas the other diſputed long with it, and brought it often very low: one ſees the marks of Liberty in <hi>Vincenza</hi> in the riches of their Palaces and Churches, of which many are newly built: They have a modern Theater made in imitation of the ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Theaters. Count <hi>Valarano</hi>'s Gardens at the Port of <hi>Verona,</hi> is the ſineſt thing of the Town, there is in it a very noble Alley of Oranges and Cttrons, ſome as big as a Mans body, but thoſe are covered all the Winter long, for in this appears the ſenſible difference of <hi>Lombardy</hi> from thoſe parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> that lies to the <hi>South</hi> of the <hi>Apenins,</hi> that here generally they keep their Oranges and Citrons in great Boxes as we do in <hi>England,</hi> that ſo they may be lodged in Winter, and defended from the breezes that blow ſometimes ſo ſharp from the <hi>Alps,</hi> that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they would kill thoſe delicate Plants: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in <hi>Tuſcany</hi> they grow as other Trees in their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> they grow wild without any care or cultivation. We were at <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenza</hi> upon a Holy-day, and there I ſaw a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a Proceſſion that was to be in the afternoon: I did not wonder at what a <hi>French</hi> Papiſt ſaid to me, that he could hardly bear the Religion of <hi>Italy,</hi> the Idolatry in it was ſo groſs. The ſtatue of the Virgin
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60829:53"/> was of Wood ſo finely painted, that I thought the Head was Wax, it was richly clad, and had a Crown on its Head, and was ſet full of Flowers: how they did when it was carried about, I do not know; but in the morning all People run to it and ſaid their Prayers to it, ond kiſſed the ground before it with all the appearances of devotion.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Vincenza</hi> it is Eighteen miles to <hi>Padua</hi> all like a Garden; here one ſees the decays of a vaſt City, which was, once, one of the biggeſt of all <hi>Italy;</hi> the compaſs is the ſame that it was, but there is much uninhabited ground in it, and Houſes there go almoſt for nothing, their Air is extream good, and there is ſo great a plenty of all things except money, that a little money goes a great way. The Univerſity here, though ſo much ſupported by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> that they pay fifty Profeſſors, yet ſinks extreamly: there are no Men of any great fame now in it: and the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels among the Students have driven away moſt of the ſtrangers that uſed to come and ſtudy here, for it is not ſafe to ſtir abroad here after Sun ſet: The number of the Palaces here is incredible, and though the Nobility of <hi>Padua</hi> is almoſt quite ruined, yet the beauty of their ancient Palaces ſhews what they once were. The <hi>Venetians</hi> have been willing to let the ancient quarrels that were in all thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Cities continue ſtill among them, for while one kills another, and the Children of the other take their revenges afterwards, both comes under the <hi>bando</hi> by this means, and the Confiſcation goes to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. At ſome times of grace when the Senate wants Money, and offers a Pardon to all that will compound for it, the numbers of the guilty Perſons are incredible. In <hi>Vincenza</hi> and the Country that belongs to it, I was aſſured by Monſieur <hi>Patin,</hi> that learned Antiquary, that hath been many years a Profeſſor in <hi>Padua,</hi> that there were Five and thirty thouſand pardoned at the laſt Grace; this I could hardly believe, but he bid me
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60829:53"/> write it down upon his word. The Nobility of <hi>Padua</hi> and of the other Towns, ſeem not to ſee what a profit their quarrels bring to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and how they eat out their Families: For one Family in the ſame Man's time, who was alive while I was there, was redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from Fourteen thouſand Ducats revenue to leſs than Three thouſand, by its falling at ſeveral times under the <hi>bando:</hi> But their jealouſies and their reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are purſued by them with ſo much vigor, that when theſe are in their way, all other things are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got by them. There is here the remnant of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitheater, though nothing but the outward Wall ſtands: There is here, as well as in <hi>Milan,</hi> an inward Town, called the City, and an outward, without that, called the <hi>Burgo;</hi> but though there is a Ditch about the City, the great Ditch and Wall goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout all and <hi>Padua</hi> is Eight miles in compaſs; it lies almoſt round: The publick Hall is the Nobleſt of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly:</hi> the Dome is an ancient and mean Building; but the Church of St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> eſpecially the Holy Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in it where the Saint lies, is one of the beſt pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of modern Sculpture; for round the Chapel the chief Miracles in the legend of that Saint are repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Mezzo rilievo,</hi> in a very ſurprizing manner: The devotion that is paid to this Saint, all <hi>Lombardy</hi> over, is amazing; he is called by way of excellence <hi>il Santo,</hi> and the Beggars generally ask Alms for his ſake: But among the little, Vows that hang without the Holy Chapel, there is one that is the higheſt pitch of Blaſphemy that can be imagined <hi>Exaudit,</hi> ſpeaking of the Saint <hi>quos non audit &amp; ipſe Deus,</hi> he hears thoſe whom God himſelf doth not hear. St. <hi>Juſtina</hi> is a Church ſo well ordered within, the Architecture is ſo beautiful, it is ſo well inlightned, and the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulo</hi>'s are ſo advantagiouſly placed that if the outſide anſwered the inſide, it would be one of the beſt Churches of <hi>Italy,</hi> but the Building is of Brick, and it hath no Frontiſpiece, there are many new Altars
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60829:54"/> made as fine as they are Idolatrous, all full of Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of Marble. This Abby hath a Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Ducats of Revenue, and ſo by its Wealth one may conclude that it belongs to the <hi>Benedictine</hi> Order. Cardinal <hi>Barberigo</hi> is Biſhop here, he ſeems to ſet St. <hi>Carlo</hi> before him as his pattern; he hath founded a Noble Seminary for the ſecular Prieſts; he lives in a conſtant diſcipline himſelf, and endeavours to reform his Clergy all he can; but he is now in ill terms with his Canons, who are all Noble <hi>Venetians,</hi> and ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low themſelves great liberties, of which they will not be willingly abridged; he is charitable to a high degree, and is in all reſpects a very extraordinary Man.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Venetian</hi> Territory, their ſubjects live eaſie and happy, if they could be ſo wiſe as to give over their quarrels, but though the taxes are not high, they oppreſs their Tenants ſo ſeverely, that the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants live moſt miſerably, yet on all hands round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, the oppreſſions being more intollerable, they know not whither to go for eaſe, whereas on the contrary, the miſeries under which their neighbours groan, chiefly thoſe of the Eccleſiaſtical ſtate, ſend in an increaſe of People among them, ſo that they are well ſtockt with People, but the <hi>Venetians</hi> are ſo jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of their ſubjects underſtanding Military matters, which may diſpoſe them to revolt, that they never make any Levies among them for their Wars, this jealouſie is the true ground of that maxim, though another is pretended that is more plauſible, which is their care of their own People, whom they ſtudy to preſerve, and therefore they hire Strangers rather than expoſe their Subjects. It is certain a revolt here were no hard matter to effectuate, for the Garriſons and Fortifications are ſo ſlight, that thoſe great Towns could eaſily ſhake off their yoke, if it were not for the factions that ſtill reign among them, by which one party would chuſe rather to expoſe the other to the rigor of the Inquiſitors than concur with them in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60829:54"/> their liberty, and the Inquiſitors in ſuch caſes proceed ſo ſecretly, and yet ſo effectually that none dares truſt another with a ſecret of ſuch conſequence, and the oppreſſed Nobility of thoſe States retain ſtill ſo much of their old and unſubdued inſolence, and treat ſuch as are under them ſo cruelly, that the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e as ſecure in thoſe Conqueſts, as if they had many ſtrong Cittadels and numerous Garriſons ſpread up and down among them. From <hi>Padua</hi> down to <hi>Venice,</hi> all along the River <hi>Brent,</hi> there are many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces of the Noble <hi>Venetians</hi> on both ſides of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, built with ſo great a variety of Architecture, that there is not one of them like another, there is alſo the like diverſity in the laying out of their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and here they retire during the hot months, and ſome allow themſelves all the exceſſes of diſſolute liberty that can poſſibly be imagined. From <hi>Lizza Fucina</hi> which is at the mouth of the <hi>Brent,</hi> we paſs for Five or Six miles on the <hi>Lagunes</hi> or ſhallows to <hi>Venice,</hi> theſe ſhallows ſink of late ſo much that the preſerving <hi>Venice</hi> ſtill an Iſland, is like to become as great a charge to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> as the keeping out the Sea is to the Dutch; for they uſe all poſſible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry to cleanſe the Channels of their <hi>lagunes,</hi> and to keep them full of water; and yet many think that the water hath failed ſo much in this laſt age, that if it continues to abate at the ſame rate, within an age or two more, <hi>Venice</hi> may become apart of the <hi>Terra firma.</hi> It is certainly the moſt ſurprizing ſight in the whole World, to ſee ſo vaſt a city, ſcituated thus in the Sea, and ſuch a number of Iſlands ſo u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited together by Bridges brought to ſuch a regular figure, the Pilotty ſupplying the want of earth to build on, and all ſo nobly built, which is of all the things that one can ſee the moſt amazing. And though this Republick is much ſunk from what it was, both by the great loſſes they have ſuffered in their Wars with the <hi>Turks,</hi> and by the great decay of Trade, yet
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60829:55"/> there is an incredible Wealth, and a vaſt plenty of all things in this place. I will not offer to deſcribe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church nor the Palace of S. <hi>Mark,</hi> which are too well known to need a long digreſſion to be made for them. The painting of the Walls and the roofs of the Halls, and publick Rooms in the Palace, are of vaſt value: Here I ſaw that Story of Pope <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> the III. treading on the neck of the Emperor <hi>Frederick Barbaroſſa.</hi> The nobleneſs of the ſtair-caſes, the riches of the Halls, and the beauty of the whole building, are much prejudiced by the beaſtlineſs of thoſe that walk along, and that leave their marks behind them, as if this were rather a common houſe of Office, than ſo Noble a Palace: And the great Hall, where the whole body of the Nobility meet, in the Great Council, hath nothing but the roof and walls that anſwers to ſuch an Aſſembly; for the ſeats are liker the benches of an Auditory of Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, than of ſo glorious a body. When the two ſides of this Palace are built as the third, which is the moſt hid, it will be one of the gloriouſeſt Palaces that the World can ſhew. The two ſides that are moſt ſeen, the one facing the ſquare of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and the other the great <hi>Canale,</hi> are only of Brick, the third being all of Marble, but the War of <hi>Candy</hi> put a ſtop to the building. St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Church hath nothing to recommend it, but its great antiquity, and the vaſt riches of the building, it is dark and low, but the pavement is ſo rich a Moſaick, and the whole roof is alſo Moſaick, the outſide, and inſide are of ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Marble, the frontiſpiece is adorned with ſo many Pillars of Porphiry and Jaſp, and above all with the four Horſes of Corinthian Braſs, that <hi>Tiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi> brought to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> which were carried after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and were brought from thence to <hi>Venice,</hi> and in which the gilding is ſtill very bright, that when all this is conſidered one doth no where ſee ſo much coſt brought together. I did not ſee the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60829:55"/> Goſpel of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> which is one of the valuableſt things of the Treaſure; but they do not now open it to ſtrangers, yet Doctor <hi>Grandi,</hi> a famous Phyſitian there, told me that, by a particular order, he was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to open it; he told me it was all writ in Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Letters, but the characters were ſo worn out, that though he could diſcern the ends of ſome Letters, he could not ſee enough to help him to diſtinguiſh them or to know whether the M. S. was in <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latin.</hi> I will not ſay one word of the Arſenal, for as I ſaw it in its worſt ſtate, the War that is now on foot hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing disfurniſhed a great deal of it, ſo it hath been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten deſcribed, and it is known to be the Nobleſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine, the beſt ordered, and of the greateſt variety that is in the whole World; its true it is all that this State hath, ſo that if the Magazines of other Princes, which lie ſpread up and down in the different places of their dominions were gathered together, they would make a much greater ſhew. The Nobleſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of <hi>Venice</hi> is that of the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> called St. <hi>John,</hi> and S. <hi>Paul,</hi> the Church, and Chapels are vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rich; there is one of St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s <hi>Madona</hi>'s here as they pretend; the Dormitory is very great; the Room for the Library, and every thing in it, except the Books, is extream fine. But St. <hi>George,</hi> which is a Convent of the <hi>Benedictines</hi> in an Iſle intirely poſſeſſed by them over againſt the St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s ſquare is much the richeſt; the Church is well contrived and well adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and not only the whole building is very magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, but which is more extraordinary at <hi>Venice</hi> they have a large Garden, and noble walks in it. The <hi>Redemptore,</hi> and the <hi>Salute</hi> are two Noble Churches that are the effects of Vows that the Senate made when they were afflicted with the Plague, the latter is much the finer, it is to the <hi>Virgin,</hi> and the other is only to our <hi>Saviour;</hi> ſo naturally doth the devotion of that Church carry it higher for the Mother than the Son: It is true the <hi>Salute</hi> is later than the other, ſo
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60829:56"/> no wonder if the Architecture, and the riches exceed that which is more ancient. The School of St. <hi>Roch.</hi> and the Chapel, and Hall are full of great pieces of <hi>Tintorets;</hi> a <hi>Cena</hi> of <hi>Paulo Veroneſe</hi> in the Refectory of St. <hi>George,</hi> and the Picture of St. <hi>Peter</hi> the Martyr of <hi>Titians</hi> are the moſt celebrated pieces of <hi>Venice:</hi> Duke <hi>Peſaro</hi>'s Tomb in the Frairy is the Nobleſt I ever ſaw. But if the riches of all the Convents, and the Pariſh Churches of <hi>Venice</hi> amazed me, the fronts eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, many of which are of white Marble, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with ſeveral Statues; the meanneſs of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary of St. <hi>Mark</hi> did no leſs ſurprize me. There are in the Antichamber to it, Statues of vaſt value, and the whole roof of the Library is compoſed of ſeveral pieces of the greateſt Maſters put in ſeveral frames; but the Library hath nothing anſwerable to the riches of the caſe, for the <hi>Greek</hi> Manuſcripts are all modern, I turned over a great many, and ſaw none above Five Hundred Years old: I was indeed told that the laſt Library-keeper was accuſed for having conveyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way many of their Manuſcripts; and that Four Years ago being clapt in Priſon for this by the Inquiſitors, he, to prevent further ſeverities, poyſoned himſelf. I went to the Convent of the <hi>Servi,</hi> but I found Father <hi>Paul</hi> was not in ſuch conſideration there, as he is elſe where: I asked for his Tomb, but they made no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of him, and ſeemed not to know where it was; it is true the Perſon to whom I was recommended was not in <hi>Venice,</hi> ſo perhaps they refined too much in this matter: I had great diſcourſe with ſome at <hi>Venice</hi> concerning the memorials out of which <hi>F. Paul</hi> drew his Hiſtory, which are no doubt all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved with great care in their Archives, and ſince the tranſactions of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> as they are of great importance, ſo they are become now much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted by the different relations that <hi>F. Paul,</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Pallavicini</hi> have given the World of that matter; the only way to put an end to all diſputes
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60829:56"/> in matter of fact, is to print the Originals themſelves: A Perſon of great credit at <hi>Venice</hi> promiſed to me to do his utmoſt, to get that propoſition ſet on foot, tho the great exactneſs that the Government there hath always affected as to the matter of their Archives, is held ſo ſacred that this made him apprehend they would not give way to any ſuch ſearch. The affinity of the matter brings into my mind a long Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that I had with a Perſon of great Eminence at <hi>Venice,</hi> that as he was long at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ſo was learned far beyond what is to be met with in <hi>Italy,</hi> he told me he was at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> when the Inquiry into the Doctrine of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church was ſet on foot, occaſioned by the famous Diſpute between Mr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> and Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> he being a zealous Roman Catholick, was dealt with to aſſiſt in that buſineſs; but being a Man of great Honour and Sincerity, he excuſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſaid he could not meddle in it: He hath a very low and bad opinion of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and he told me that none of their Prieſts were more inveterate enemies to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> than thoſe that were bred up at <hi>Rome;</hi> for they to free themſelves of the prejudices that their Countrey-men are apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive againſt them, becauſe of their education among the <hi>Latines</hi> do affect to ſhew an oppoſition to the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> Church beyond any other <hi>Greeks.</hi> He told me that he knew the ignorance and corruption of the <hi>Greeks</hi> was ſuch, that as they did not know the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of their own Church, ſo a very little Money, or the hope of Protection from any of the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors that come from the <hi>Weſt,</hi> would prevail with them to ſign any that that co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60829:57"/> For their Rites not being changed now for a great many ages were the true Indications of the doctrines received among them; whereas they were both ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the tradition of their doctrine, and very apt to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

To this I will add what an eminent <hi>Catholick</hi> at <hi>Paris</hi> told me, he ſaid the Originals of thoſe atteſtations were in too exact and too correct a ſtile to have been formed in <hi>Greece,</hi> he aſſured me they were penned at <hi>Paris</hi> by one that was a Maſter of the purity of the <hi>Greek</hi> tongue.

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60829:57"/> to remember the blemiſh of her deſcent of the one ſide, for though the <hi>Cornara</hi>'s reckon themſelves a ſize of Nobility beyond all the other Families of <hi>Venice,</hi> yet her Father having entertained a <hi>Gondalier</hi>'s Daughter ſo long that he had ſome Children by her, at laſt for their ſakes Married the Mother, and payed a conſiderable fine to ſave the forfeiture of Nobility, which his Children muſt have undergone, by reaſon of the meanneſs of the Mothers birth. The <hi>Cornara</hi>'s carry it ſo high that many of the Daughters of that Family have made themſelves Nuns, becauſe they thought their own name was ſo Noble that they could not induce themſelves to change it with any other, and when lately one of that Family married the Heir of the <hi>Sagredo,</hi> which is alſo one of the ancienteſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies that was extream rich, and ſhe had ſcarce any portion at all, for the <hi>Cornara</hi>'s are now very low, ſome of their Friends came to wiſh them joy of ſo advantagious a match; but they very coldly rejected the complement, and bid the others go and wiſh the <hi>Sagreda</hi> joy, ſince they thought the advantage was wholly of their ſide.</p>
               <p>There are of the truly ancient Noble Families of <hi>Venice</hi> Four and Twenty yet remaining, and even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theſe there are twelve that are thought ſuperior to the reſt in rank; ſince the firſt formation of their Senate they have created many Senators. In their Wars with <hi>Genua</hi> they conferred that honour on Thirty Families; ſeveral of their Generals have had that honour given them as a reward of their ſervice: They have alſo offered this honour to ſome Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies: for both the Families of <hi>Valois</hi> and <hi>Bourbon</hi> were nobles of <hi>Venice,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the III. when he came through <hi>Venice</hi> from <hi>Poland</hi> to take poſſeſſion of the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> went and ſate among them, and drew his ballot as a Noble <hi>Venetian;</hi> many Popes have procured this honour for their Nephews; Only the

                  <hi>Barberines</hi> would have the <hi>Venetians</hi> offer it to them without their asking it, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> would not give it without the others asked it, and ſo it ſtuck at this.

In all the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of Senators before the laſt War of <hi>Candy,</hi> they were free; and the conſiderations were either great ſervices, or the great dignity of thoſe on whom they beſtowed this Honour. Thoſe new Families are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into thoſe that are called Ducal Families, and thoſe that were called ſimply new Families, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the former deſignation is not rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; but one that knew all that related to that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution particularly well gave me a good account of it: That which naturally occurs as the reaſon of it, is, that all thoſe Families that are called Ducal, have had the Dukedom in their houſe: But as all the old Families have had the ſame honour, though they carry not that Title, ſo ſome of the new Families have alſo had it, that yet are not called Ducal. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſay that thoſe Families that have had branches, who have been made Dukes, without their being firſt Procurators of S. <hi>Mark,</hi> or that have been choſen to that honour, without their pretending to it, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Ducal: But the true account of this is, that from the Year 1450. to the Year 1620. for a Hundred and Seventy Years there was a combination made among thoſe new Families to preſerve the Dukedom ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them: For the old Families carrying it high, and excluding the new Families from the chief Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, Nineteen of the new Families entred into mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual engagements to exclude the ancient Nobility: It is true they made the Dukedom ſometimes fall on ſome of the new Families that were not of this Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation;
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60829:58"/> but this was more indifferent to them, as long as the ancient Families were ſhut out, and that it appeared that they bore the chief ſway in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. This Combination was a thing known to the very People, though the Inquiſitors did all they could to break it, and at leaſt to hide it, ſo that I never met with it in any of their Authors: But this failed in the Year 1620. when <hi>Memmio</hi> was choſen Duke, who was deſcended of one of the ancient Nobility, which was ſo great a mortification to the caſe Ducale that one of them <hi>(Venniero)</hi> hanged himſelf, by the rage to which that diſgrace drove him, yet his Man came into the room in time before he was dead, and cut him down, and he lived long after that in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mind. Since that time one of the <hi>Bembo</hi>'s, two of the <hi>Cornaro</hi>'s, and one of the <hi>Contrarini</hi>'s, and the preſent Prince of the <hi>Juſtiniani,</hi> the firſt of that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily that hath had that honour, have been Dukes, who are all of the ancient Families: So that this F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is now ſo intirely buried, that it is not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally known, even in <hi>Venice</hi> it ſelf, that it was ever amongſt them; and thus time and other accidents bring about happy events, which no care nor induſtry could produce: For that which all the endeavours of the Inquiſitors could not compaſs, was brought about of it ſelf.</p>
               <p>It is true, the Factions in <hi>Venice,</hi> though violent enough in the perſons of thoſe who manage them, yet are not derived by them as an inheritance to their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, as it was among the <hi>Florentines;</hi> who though they value themſelves as a ſize of Men much above the <hi>Venetians,</hi> whom they deſpiſe as a phlegmatick and dull race of People, yet ſhewed how little they underſtood with all their vivacity, to conduct their ſtate, ſince by their domeſtick heats they loſt their liberty, which the <hi>Venetians</hi> have had the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſtill to preſerve. This Faction of the Caſe Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cale
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60829:59"/> was perhaps willing to let the matter fall, for they loſt more than they got by it; for the ancient Families in revenge ſet themſelves againſt them, and excluded them from all the other advantagious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments of the State. For the others being only united in that ſingle point relating to the Dukedom, the ancient Families let them carry it, but in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Competitions they ſet up always ſuch Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors againſt the pretenders that were of the Ducal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, that were much more eſteemed than theſe were, ſo that they ſhut them out of all the beſt Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the <hi>Republick.</hi> Such a Faction as this was, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Yet the greateſt part of the beſt Families court this Honour of Dukedom ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly; when <hi>Segrado</hi> was upon the point of being choſen Duke, there was ſo violent an outcry againſt it over all <hi>Venice,</hi> becauſe of the diſgrace, that they thought would come on the <hi>Republick,</hi> if they had a Prince whoſe Note had miſcarried in ſome unfortunate diſorders, the Senate complyed ſo far with this Averſion, that the People teſtified, That though the Inquiſitors took care to hang or drown many of the chief of the Mutineers, yet they let the deſign for <hi>Sagredo</hi> fall: Upon which he was ſo much diſguſted that he retired to a houſe he had in the <hi>Terra firma,</hi> and never appeared more at <hi>Venice:</hi> During which time of his retirement, he writ two Books, the one <hi>Memorie Ottomaniche,</hi> which is Printed, and he is accounted the beſt of all the Modern Authors: The other was Memoir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It hath been a ſort of maxim now for ſome time, not to chuſe a married Man to be Duke, for the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation of a Dutcheſs goes high, and hath coſt above Hundred thouſand Ducats. Some of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Families have affected the Title of Prince, and have called their branches Princes of the Blood, and though the <hi>Cornara</hi>'s have done this more than any other, yet others upon the account of ſome Principalities, that their Anceſtors had in the Iſlands of the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> have alſo affected thoſe vain Titles: But the Inquiſitors have long ago obliged them to lay aſide all thoſe high Titles,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60829:60"/> and ſuch of them that boaſt too much of their Blood, find the diſlike which that brings on them very ſenſibly; for whenſoever they pretend to any great Employments, they find themſelves always excluded. When an Election of Ambaſſadors was propoſed, or of any of the chief Offices, it was wont to be made in thoſe terms, that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil muſt chuſe one of its principal Members for ſuch an Employment: But becauſe this lookt like a term of diſtinction, among the Nobility, they changed it Five and twenty Years ago; and inſtead of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, they uſe now the term Honourable, which comprehends the whole body of the Nobility, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diſtinction. It is at <hi>Venice</hi> in the Church, as well as in the State, that the Head of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy hath a great Title, and particular Honours done him; whereas in the mean while this is a meer Pageantry, and under theſe big words there is lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only a light ſhadow of Authority; for their Biſhop has the glorious Title of Patriark, as well as the Duke is called their Prince, and his ſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and hath his name ſtampt upon their Coin, ſo the Patriark with all his high Title hath real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no Authority: For not only St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Church is intirely exempted from his juriſdiction, and is immediately ſubject to the Duke, but his Authority is in all other things ſo ſubject to the Senate, and ſo regulated by them, that he hath no more power than they are pleaſed to allow him: So that the Senate is as really the ſupream Governor over all Perſons, and in all Cauſes as the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have pretended to be in their own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions ſince the Rrformation: But beſides all this, the Clergy of <hi>Venice</hi> have a very extraordinary ſort of exemption, and are a ſort of a Body like a Presbytery independent of the Biſhop: The Curats are choſen by the Inhabitants of every Pariſh, and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60829:60"/> this makes that no Noble <hi>Venetian</hi> is ſuffered to pretend to any Curacy, for they think it below that Dignity to ſuffer one of their Body to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in a Competition with one of a lower Order, and to run the hazard of being rejected.</p>
               <p>I was told the manner of thoſe Elections was the moſt ſcandalous thing poſſible, for the ſeveral Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didates appear on the day of election, and ſet out their own merits, and defame the other pretenders in the fouleſt language, and in the moſt ſcurrilous manner imaginable; the ſecrets of all their lives are publiſht in moſt reproachful terms, and nothing is ſo abject and ridiculous that is not put in practice on thoſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions: There is a ſort of an Aſſociation among the Curats for judging of their common concerns, and ſome of the Laity of the ſeveral Pariſhes aſſiſt in thoſe Courts, ſo that here is a real <hi>Presbytery.</hi> The great libertinage that is ſo undecently practiſed by moſt ſorts of people at <hi>Venice,</hi> extends it ſelf to the Clergy to ſuch a degree, that though ignorance and vice ſeem the only indelible characters that they carry generally over all <hi>Italy,</hi> yet thoſe appear here in a much more conſpicuous manner than elſewhere, and upon thoſe popular elections all comes out. The Nuns of <hi>Venice</hi> have been under much ſcandal for a great while; there are ſome Monaſteries that are as famous for their ſtrictneſs and exactneſs to their rules, as others are for the liberties they take; chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe of St. <hi>Zachary</hi> and St. <hi>Lawrence,</hi> where none but Noble <hi>Venetians</hi> are admitted, and where it is not ſo much as pretended that they have retired for devotion; but it is owned to be done meerly that they might not be too great a charge to their Family: They are not vailed, their neck and breaſt is bare, and they receive much company: but that which I ſaw was in a publick Room, in which there were many grills for ſeveral Parlors, ſo that the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60829:61"/> is very confuſed, for there being a different com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany at every grill, and the <hi>Italians</hi> ſpeaking gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally very loud, the noiſe of ſo many loud talkers is very diſagreeable. The Nuns talk much and very ungracefully, and allow themſelves a liberty in rally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that other places could not bear. About four years ago the Patriark intended to bring in a reform into thoſe Houſes, but the Nuns of St. <hi>Lawrence</hi> with whom he began, told him plainly they were Noble <hi>Venetians,</hi> who had choſen that way of life as more convenient for them, but they would not ſubject themſelves to his regulations, yet he came and would ſhut up their houſe, ſo they went to ſet fire to it; upon which the Senate interpoſed and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Patriark to deſiſt. There is no Chriſtian State in the World that hath expreſſed a jealouſie of Churchmens getting into the publick Councels ſo much as the <hi>Venetians,</hi> for as a Noble <hi>Venetian</hi> that goes into Orders, looſes thereby his right of going to vote in the great Councel, ſo when any of them are promoted to be Cardinals, the whole kindred and family muſt during their lives, withdraw from the great Councel, and are alſo incapable of all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments: And by a clauſe which they added when they received the Inquiſition, which ſeemed of no great conſequence, they have made it to become a Court abſolutely ſubject to them; for it being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that the Inquiſitors ſhould do nothing but in the preſence of ſuch as ſhould be Deputed by the Senate to be the witneſſes of their proceedings; thoſe Deputies either will not come but when they think fit, or will not ſtay longer than they are pleaſed with their proceedings; ſo that either their abſence or their withdrawing diſſolves the Court: for a citati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot be made, a witneſs cannot be examined, nor the leaſt point of form carried on if the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Senate are not preſent: and thus it is,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60829:61"/> that though there is a Court of Inquiſition at <hi>Venice,</hi> yet there is ſcarce any perſon brought into trouble by it, and there are many of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion that live there without any trouble; and though there is a Congregation of them there that hath their exerciſes of Religion very regularly, yet the Senate gives them no trouble. It is true, the Hoſty's not being carried about in Proceſſion, but ſecretly by the Prieſt to the Sick, makes that this uneaſie diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of <hi>Proteſtant</hi> and <hi>Papiſt</hi> doth not offer it ſelf here as in other places, for the ſtraitneſs of the Streets and the Channels through which one muſt go almoſt every foot, makes that this could not be done in <hi>Venice</hi> as it is elſewhere, and from <hi>Venice</hi> this rule is carried over their whole Territory, tho the like reaſon doth not hold in the <hi>Terra Firma</hi> The <hi>Venetians</hi> are generally ignorant of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion to a ſcandal, and they are as uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned in them as they are ſtrangers to them, ſo that all that vaſt pomp in their Ceremonies and wealth in their Churches is affected rather as a point of magnificence, or a matter of emulation among fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, then that ſuperſtition hath here ſuch a power over the Spirits of the people as it hath elſewhere: for the Atheiſm that is received by many here is the dulleſt and curſeſt thing that can be imagined. The young Nobility are ſo generally corrupted in their Morals, and ſo given up to a moſt ſupine ignorance of all ſort of knowledge, that a man cannot eaſily imagine to what a height this is grown, and for Military Courage there is ſcarce ſo much as the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of being thought brave remaining among the greater part of them. It ſeemed to me a ſtrange thing to ſee the <hi>Broglio</hi> ſo full of graceful young Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators and Nobles, when there was ſo glorious a Wa on foot with the <hi>Turks,</hi> but inſtead of being heated in point of honour to hazard their lives, they rather
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60829:62"/> think it an extravagant piece of folly for them to go and hazard it when a little money can hire ſtrangers that do it on ſuch eaſie terms; and thus their Arms are in the hands of ſtrangers, while they ſtay at home managing their intrigues in the <hi>Broglio,</hi> and diſſolving their ſpirits among their Courtiſans. And the reputation of their ſervice is of late years ſo much ſunk, that it is very ſtrange to ſee ſo many come to a ſervice ſo decried, where there is ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle care had of the Souldiers, and ſo little regard had to the Officers; the arrears are ſo ſlowly paid, and the rewards are ſo ſcantly diſtributed, that if they do not change their maxims they may come to feel this very ſenſibly; for as their Subjects are not acquainted with Warlike matters, ſo their. Nobility have no ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It is chiefly to the conjecture of affairs that they owe their ſafety, for the feebleneſs of all their Neighbours, the <hi>Turk,</hi> the <hi>Emperour,</hi> the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Pope, and the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> preſerves them from the apprehenſion of an Invaſion, and the quarrels, and the degeneracy of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, ſave them from the fears of a Revolt, but a formidable Neighbour would put them hard to it. One great occaſion of the degeneracy of the <hi>Italians,</hi> and in particular of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, is a maxim that hath been taken up for ſome conſiderable time, that for the preſervation of their Families, it is fit than only one of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily ſhould marry; to which I will not add that it is generally believed that the Wife is in common to the whole Family: By this means the younger Brothers that have appointments for life, and that have no Families that come from them, are not ſtirred up by any ambition to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalize themſelves or to make Families, and ſo they give way to all the lazineſs of luxury, and are quite enervated by it.</p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:60829:62"/>
               <p>Whereas the beſt ſervices done in other States flows from the neceſſities as well as the aſpirings of younger Brothers or their Families, whoſe blood qualifies them to pretend, as well as their pride and neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties puſh them on, to acquire firſt a reputation, and then a fortune: But all this is a myſtery to the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians,</hi> who apprehend ſo much from the active Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of a neceſſitous Nobility, that to lay thoſe to ſleep, they incourage them in all thoſe things that may blunt and depreſs their minds, and youth nat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Yet I muſt add one thing, that though <hi>Venice,</hi> is the place in the whole World where pleaſure is moſt ſtudied, and where the youth have both the greateſt Wealth, and the moſt leiſure to purſue it: yet it is the place that I ever ſaw where true and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent pleaſure is the leaſt underſtood, in which I will make a little digreſſion that perhaps will not be unpleaſant. As for the pleaſures of friendſhip or marriage they are ſtrangers to them, for the horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſtruſt, in which they all live, of one another, makes that it is very rare to find a friend in <hi>Italy,</hi> but moſt of all in <hi>Venice:</hi> and though we have been told of ſeveral ſtories of celebrated friendſhips there, yet theſe are now very rare. As for their Wives they are bred to ſo much ignorance, they converſe ſo little, that they know nothing but the dull ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on Holy-days in which they ſtay in the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es as long as they can, and ſo prolong the little li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty they have of going abroad on thoſe days as Children do their hours of play: They are not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in their domeſtick affairs, and generally they underſtand no ſort of work, ſo that I was told that they were the inſipideſt creatures imaginable; they are, perhaps, as vitious as in other places; but it is
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60829:63"/> among them down-right lewdneſs, for they are not drawn into it by the intranglements of amour that inveigle and lead many perſons much farther than they imagined or intended at firſt, but in them the firſt ſtep without any preamble or preparative, is down-right beaſtlineſs. And an <hi>Italian</hi> that knew the World well, ſaid upon this matter a very lively thing to me, he ſaid their jealouſie made them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain their Daughters, and their Wives ſo much, that they could have none of thoſe domeſtick enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments of Wit, Converſation, and Friendſhip, that the <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Engliſh</hi> have at home: It is true thoſe he ſaid hazard a little the honour of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies by that liberty, but the <hi>Italians</hi> by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive caution, made that they had none of the true delights of a Married State; and notwithſtanding all their uneaſie jealouſie, they were ſtill in danger of a contraband Nobility, therefore he thought they would do much better to hazard a little, when it would produce a certain ſatisfaction, then to watch ſo anxiouſly, and thereby have an inſipid companion inſtead of a lively Friend, though ſhe might, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, have ſome ill moments. As for their houſes they have nothing convenient at <hi>Venice,</hi> for the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture is almoſt all the ſame, one ſtair-caſe, a Hall that runs along the body of the houſe, and chambers on both hands, but there are no apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, no Cloſets or Back-ſtairs; ſo that in houſes that are of an exceſſive wealth, they have yet no ſort of convenience; Their Bedſteads are of Iron, becauſe of the Vermin that their moiſture produces, the bottoms are of boards, upon which they lay ſo many quilts that it is a huge ſtep to get up to them, their great Chairs are all upright without a ſtop in the back, hard in the bottom, and the wood of the arms is not covered; they mix water with their wine in their Hogſheads, ſo that for above half the year the wine is either dead or ſour, they do not leaven
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60829:63"/> their Bread, ſo that it is extream heavy, and the Oven is too much heated, ſo that the crum is as Dough, when the cruſt is hard as a ſtone, in all Inns they boil Meat firſt before it is roaſted, and thus, as indeed they make it tender, ſo it is quite taſtleſs and inſipid: And as for their Land-carriage all <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy</hi> over, it is extream inconvenient, for their Coaches are faſtned to the pearch, which makes them as uneaſie as a Cart: It it true, they begin to have at <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> Coaches that are faſtned to a ſort of double pearch, that runs round the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Coach of both ſides, which are thin that they ply to the motion of the Coach, and are extream eaſie, but thoſe are not known in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> and beſides this, their Caleſhes are open, ſo that one is expoſed to the Sun, and duſt in Summer, and to the Weather in Winter: But though they are covered as ours are, on the other ſide of the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penins,</hi> yet I ſaw none that were covered in <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy:</hi> And thus by an enumeration of many of the innocent pleaſures, and conveniences of life, it appears that the <hi>Venetians</hi> purſue ſo violently for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden pleaſures, that they know not how to find out that which is allowable. Their conſtant pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices in the <hi>Broglio</hi> is their chief buſineſs, where thoſe that are neceſſitous are purſuing for Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of advantage, and thoſe that are full of wealth take a ſort of pleaſure in croſſing their pretentions, and in embroiling matters. The walk in which the Nobility tread is left to them, for no others dare walk among them, and they change the ſide of the ſquare of St. <hi>Mark</hi> as the Sun, and the Weather di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects them. Perhaps a derivation that Mr. <hi>Patin</hi> gave me of <hi>Brolio</hi> from the Greek <hi>Peribolâion,</hi> a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle corrupted is not forced; and ſince they make all their parties, and manage all their intreague in thoſe Walks, I am apt to think that broils, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villons and imbroilments are derived from the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60829:64"/> agitations that are managed in thoſe walks.</p>
               <p>As for the laſt created Nobility of <hi>Venice,</hi> I came to know ſome particulars that I have not yet ſeen in any books, which I ſuppoſe will not be unacceptable to you. It is certain that if the <hi>Venetians</hi> could have foreſeen at the beginning of the War of <hi>Candy,</hi> the vaſt expence in which the length of it engaged them, they would have abandoned the Iſle, rather than have waſted their Treaſure, and debaſed their Nobility. This laſt was extream ſenſible to them; for as the dignity of the rank they hold is ſo much the more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent as it is reſtrained to a ſmall number, ſo all the beſt Imployments and Honours of the State be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to this body, the admitting ſuch a number into it, as muſt riſe out of Seventy Eight Families, was in effect the ſharing their Inheritance among ſo many adopted Brothers. This had been leſs Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous if they had communicated that Honour only to the ancient Citizens of <hi>Venice,</hi> or to the Nobility of thoſe States that they have ſubdued in the <hi>Terra firma;</hi> for as there are many Citizens who are as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient as the Nobility, only their Anceſto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be of that Council that aſſumed the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about Four Hundred Years ago, they have not been raiſed to that Honour, ſo there had been no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy in creating ſome of them to be of the Nobility. It had been alſo brought under conſultation long ago, upon the reduction of thoſe States in the <hi>Terra firma,</hi> whether it was not adviſable according to the maxims of the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> to communicate that dignity to ſome of their chief Families, as being the ſureſt way to give ſome contentment to thoſe States, it being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a real as well as a cheap ſecurity, when the chief Families in thoſe Cities, were admitted to a Share in all the Honours of the Republick. It is true ſome of the Nobility of thoſe States thought they had Honour enough by their birth, and ſo <hi>Zambara</hi> of <hi>Breſcia</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to accept an Honour from thoſe that had robbed
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60829:64"/> his Country of its liberty, yet his poſterity are now o another mind, for they came and bought in this laſt ſale of honour that which was freely offered to their Anceſtor, and was rejected by him. When the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate found it ſelf extreamly preſſed for money during the war it was at firſt propoſed that ſome Families, to the number of Five, might be enobled; they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Sixty Thouſand Ducats if they were <hi>Venetians,</hi> and Seventy Thouſand if they were Strangers: There was but one Perſon that oppoſed this in the Senate, ſo it being paſſed there, was preſented to the great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; and there it was like to have paſſed without any difficulty, but one Perſon oppoſed it with ſo much vigor, that though the Duke deſired him to give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his oppoſition, ſince the neceſſities of the War required a great ſupply, yet he perſiſted ſtill; and though one of the <hi>Savii</hi> ſet forth with tears the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities to which the State was reduced, he ſtill inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and fell upon one conceit that turned the whole Council, he ſaid they were not ſure if Five Perſons could be found that would purchaſe that honour at ſuch a rate, and then it would be a vaſt diſgrace, to expoſe the offer of Nobility firſt to ſale, and then to the affront of finding no buyers when it was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to be ſold, and by this means he put by the reſolution for that time: But then another method was taken that was more honourable, and was of a more extended conſequence. <hi>Labia</hi> was the firſt that preſented a Petition to the great Council, ſetting forth his merits towards the Republick, and deſiring that he might be thought worthy to offer a Hundred Thouſand Ducats towards the ſervice of the State; this was underſtood to be the asking to be made noble at that price. <hi>Delfino</hi> ſaid he thought every Man might be well judged worthy to offer ſuch an aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to the Publick, and that ſuch as brought that ſupply might expect a ſuitable acknowledgment from the Senate, who might afterwards of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60829:65"/> beſtow that honour on thoſe that expreſſed ſo much zeal for the Publick; and this would be too much debaſed if it were thus bought and ſold; but it ſeems the purchaſers had no mind to part with their money, and to leave the reward to the gratitude of the Council, ſo the Petition was granted in plain terms; and the Nobility ſo acquired was not only to deſcend to the Children of him that was enobled, but to his Brothers and the whole Family to ſuch a degree. After <hi>Labia</hi> a great many more came with the like Petitions, and it was not unpleaſant to ſee in what terms Merchants, that came to buy this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ſet forth their merits, which were that they had taken care to furniſh the Republick with ſuch things as were neceſſary for its preſervation. There was a ſort of a Triumvirat formed of a <hi>Jew,</hi> a <hi>Greek,</hi> and an <hi>Italian,</hi> who were the Brokers, and found out the Merchants; and at laſt brought down the price from a Hundred Thouſand to Sixty Thouſand Ducats, and no other qualifications were required if they had money enough; For when <hi>Correge</hi> ſaid to the Duke that he was afraid to ask that honour for want of merit, the Duke asked him if he had a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Thouſand Ducats, and when the other anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Summ was ready, the Duke told him that was a great merit. At laſt Seventy Eight purchaſed this honour to the great regret of <hi>Labia;</hi> who ſaid that if he had imagined that ſo many would have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him in that demand, he would have bid ſo high for it that it ſhould have been out of their power to have done it. It is true many of the Purchaſers were Ancient and Noble Families, but many others were not only Merchants, but were of the loweſt ſort of them; who as they had inriched themſelves by Trade, did then impoveriſh themſelves by the acquiſition of an honour that as it obliged them to give over their Trade, and put them in a higher way of living, ſo it hath not brought them
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60829:65"/> yet in any advantage to ballance that loſs; for they are ſo much deſpiſed, that they are generally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded when they compete with the ancient Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, though this is done with that diſcretion, that the old Families do not declare always againſt the new, for that would throw the new into a faction gainſt them, which might be a great prejudice to them, for the new are much more numerous than the old.</p>
               <p>Another great prejudice that the <hi>Republick</hi> feels by this great Promotion, is that the chief Families of the Citizens of <hi>Venice,</hi> who had been long pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in the affairs of State, and out of whom the Envoyes, the Secretaries of State, and the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour that is the head of the Citizens, as well as the Duke is the head of the Nobility, are to be choſen, having purchaſed the chief Honour of the State there is not now a ſufficient number of capable Citizens, left for ſerving the State in thoſe Employments; but this defect will be redreſt with the help of a little time. But if this increaſe of the Nobility hath leſſened the Dignity of the ancient Families, there is a regulation made in this Age that ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves a conſiderable diſtinction of Authority in their hands. Crimes againſt the State, when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by any of the Nobility, were always judged by the Inquiſitors, and the Council of Ten, but all other Crimes were judged by the Council of Forty. But in the Year 1624. one of the Nobles was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of Peculat committed in one of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the <hi>Avogadore</hi> in the pleading, as he ſet forth his Crime, called him a Rogue and a Robber: yet though his crimes were manifeſt, there being but Six and twenty Judges preſent, Twelve only condemned him, and Fourteen acquitted him; this gave great offence, for though he was acquitted by his Judges, his Crimes were evident; ſo that his Fame could not be reſtored: for the Depoſitions of the Witneſſes, and the <hi>Avogadores</hi> (or the Attorney
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60829:66"/> Generals) Charge were heard by the People; ſo it was propoſed to make a difference between the Nobility and the other Subjects: and ſince all Trials before the Forty were publick, and the Trials be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Ten were in ſecret, it ſeemed fit to remit the Nobility to be tried by the Ten: Some foreſaw that this would tend to a Tyranny, and raiſe the Dignity of the ancient Families, of whom the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Ten is always compoſed, too high: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they oppoſed it upon this ground, That ſince the Council of Forty ſent out many Orders to the Governors, it would very much leſſen their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, if they were not to be the Judges of thoſe who obliged to receive their Orders: But to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify this Oppoſition, a Proviſo was made that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to the Council of Forty, a power to Judge of the Obedience that was given to their Orders, but all other Accuſations of the Nobility were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Council of Ten: and the body of the Nobility were ſo pleaſed with this Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that was put between them and the other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that they did not ſee that this did really en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave them ſo much the more, and brought them under more danger: ſince thoſe who judge in ſecret have a freer ſcope to their paſſions, than thoſe whoſe proceedings are publick, and ſo are in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect judged by the Publick, which is often a very effectual reſtraint upon the Judges themſelves. But the Council of Ten being generally in the hands of the great Families: Whereas thoſe of all ſorts are of the Council of Forty, which was the chief Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the State, and is much Ancienter than that of Ten: It had been much more wiſely done of them to have been ſtill Judged by the Forty: And if they had thought it for their Honour to have a difference made in the way of judging the Nobility, and the other Subjects, it had been more for their ſecurity to have brought their Trials to this, That
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60829:66"/> whereas the Forty Judge all other offenders with open doors, the Nobility ſhould be judged the doors being ſhut, which is a thing they very much deſire now, but without any hope of ever obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it: For this power of Judging the Nobility is now conſidered as Right of the Ten, and if any Man would go about to change it, the Inquiſitors would be perhaps, very quick with him, as a mover of Sedition, and be, in that caſe, both Judge, and Party; Yet the Inquiſitors being apprehenſive of the diſtaſt that this might breed in the body of the Nobility, have made a ſort of regulation, though it doth not amount to much; which is, that the Nobility ſhall be Judged before the Council of Ten for atrocious caſes, ſuch as matter of State, the robbing the Publick, and other enormous Crimes; but that for all other matters they are to be Judged by the Forty: yet the Council of Ten draws all caſes before them, and none dare diſpute with them.</p>
               <p>But this leads me to ſay a little to you of that part of this Conſtitution, which is ſo much cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by ſtrangers: but is really both the greateſt glory, and the chief ſecurity of this Republick, which is the unlimited power of Inquiſitors, that extends not only to the chief of the Nobility, but to the Duke himſelf, who is ſo ſubject to them, that they may not only give him ſevere reprimands, but ſearch his Papers, make his Proceſs, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, put him to death without being bound to give an account of their Proceedings, except to the Council of Ten. This is the dread not only of all the Subjects, but of the whole Nobility, and of all that bear Office in the Republick, and makes the greateſt among them tremble, and ſo obligeth them to an exact conduct. But though it is not to be denied that upon ſome occaſions they may have been a little too ſudden, particularly in the known ſtory of <hi>Foſcarini,</hi> yet ſuch unjuſtifiable
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60829:67"/> ſeverities have occurred ſo ſeldom, that as the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of this Body in making and preſerving ſuch an Inſtitution, cannot be enough admired, ſo the dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous conduct of thoſe who mannage this vaſt truſt, ſo as not to force the Body to take it out of their hands, is likewiſe highly to be wondered at. In ſhort, the inſolence, the factions, the revenges, the neceſſities and ambition that muſt needs poſſeſs a great many Members of ſo vaſt a Body as is the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of <hi>Venice,</hi> muſt have thrown them often into many fatal Convulſions, if it were not for the dread in which they all ſtand of this Court: which hath ſo many ſpies abroad, chiefly among the <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daliers,</hi> who cannot fail to diſcover all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Commerce of <hi>Venice,</hi> beſides the ſecret ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices that are thrown in at ſo many of thoſe Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons mouths that are in ſeveral places of St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Palace, within which there are boxes that are under the Keys of the Inquiſitors, ſo that it is ſcarce poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for a Man to be long in any deſign againſt the State, and not to be diſcovered by them. And when they find any in fault, they are ſo inexorable, and ſo quick, as well as ſevere in their Juſtice, that the very fear of this is ſo effectual a reſtraint, that perhaps the long preſervation of <hi>Venice,</hi> and of its Liberty, is owing to this ſingle piece of their conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution: and the Inquiſitors are Perſons generally ſo diſtinguiſhed for their merit who muſt be all of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Families; and their Authority laſts ſo ſhort a while, that the advantages of this vaſt Authority that is lodged with them, are conſtant and viſible; whereas the unhappy inſtances of their being impoſed on, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ever the Nobility grows weary of his yoke, and throw it off, one may reckon the Glory and Proſperity of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> at an end. It was terribly attackt not long ago by <hi>Cornaro,</hi> when <hi>Jerom Cornaro</hi> was put to death for his correſpondence with <hi>Spain;</hi> he was not near a
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60829:67"/> kin to the great Family of that name, yet the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thought their Honour was ſo much toucht when one of its remoteſt branches was condemned of Treaſon, that they offered a Hundred thouſand Crowns to have ſaved him, and by conſequence to have preſerved the Family from that Infamy; but though this was not accepted, for he ſuffered as he well deſerved, yet it was ſo viſible that none of the Family were concerned in his Crimes, that it did not at all turn to their prejudice. But upon the firſt occaſion that offered it ſelf after that, to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with the proceeding of the Inquiſitors, they laid hold on it, and aggravated the matter extreamly, and moved for the limiting of their Authority, but the Great Council was wiſer than to touch ſo ſacred a part of the Government, ſo they retained their power very entire, but they manage it with all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible caution; A Forreigner that hath been many years in their Service, told me that the Stories with which ſtrangers were frighted at the Arbitrary pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that was reſted in thoſe Inquiſitors were ſlight things, in compariſon of the advantages that they found from it: And after Eleven Years ſpent in their ſervice, he ſaid, he never was ſo much as once ſent for to receive a reprimand from them. And if the Nobility, that have any Commerce with ſtrangers, confeſs it ſincerely to the Inquiſitors, they are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger by it; by if they conceal it, or any main cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of it, their Proceſs will be ſoon diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Theſe are the moſt remarkable things that I could pick up, during my ſtay at <hi>Venice.</hi> I have avoided to ſay any thing relating to their ſeveral Councels, Officers, and Judicatories, or to the other parts of their Government, which are to be found in all Books; and the Forms, by which they give Votes by Ballot, are ſo well known, that it were an abuſing of your time to enlarge my ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them; nor was I ſufficiently informed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60829:68"/> the particulars of the Sale of Nobility that is now on foot ſince this laſt War with the <hi>Turks,</hi> which hath made them willing to take up once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain this eaſie way of raiſing of Money: Nor could I give credit to that of which a Perſon of great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence there aſſured me, that there was a poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner general in <hi>Venice,</hi> that had a Salary, and was employed by the Inquiſitors to diſpatch thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom a publick proceeding would make too great a noiſe; this I could not believe, though my Author proteſted, that the Brother of one that was ſolicited to accept of the Employment, diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it to him. There is no place in the World where ſtrangers live with more freedom and I was amazed to ſee ſo little exactneſs among the Searchers of the Cuſtom-houſe; for though we had a Mullets load of Trunks and Portmantles, yet none offered to ask us, either coming or going, what we were, or what we carried with us. But the beſt and Nobleſt Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment that <hi>Venice</hi> afforded while I was there, was the company of Mr. <hi>dela Haye</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour, who as he hath ſpent his whole life in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Embaſſies, ſo he hath acquired ſo great a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the World, with ſo true a Judgment, and ſo obliging a civility, that he may well paſs for a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern; and it is no wonder to ſee him ſtill engaged in a conſtant ſucceſſion of publick Employments; and his Lady is ſo wonderful a Perſon, that I pay them both but a very ſmall part of what I owe them, in this acknowledgement, which I judge my ſelf bound to make of their extraordinary civilities to me: and indeed without the advantage of ſuch a rendezvous as I had there, a fortnights ſtay at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> had been a very tedious matter: From <hi>Venice</hi> we went again to <hi>Padua;</hi> From thence to <hi>Rovigo,</hi> which is but a ſmall Town, and ſo to the <hi>Po,</hi> which divides the Territory of the <hi>Republick,</hi> from the <hi>Ferrareſe,</hi> which is now the <hi>Popes</hi> Country, and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60829:68"/> here one ſees what a difference a good and a bad Government makes in a Countrey; for though the Soil is the ſame on both ſides of the River, and the <hi>Ferrareſe</hi> was once one of the beautifulleſt ſpots of all <hi>Italy,</hi> as <hi>Ferrara</hi> was one of its beſt Towns, while they had Princes of their own, who for a courſe of ſome Ages were Princes of ſuch Eminent virtue, and of ſo Heroical a Nobleneſs, that they were really the Fathers of their Country, nothing can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined more changed than all this is now. The Soil is abandoned, and uncultivated, nor were there hands enough ſo much as to mow their Graſs, which we ſaw withering in their Meadows to our no ſmall wonder. We were amazed to ſee ſo rich a Soil thus forſaken of its Inhabitants, and much more when we paſſed through that vaſt Town, which by its extent ſhews what it was about an Age ago, and is now ſo much deſerted, that there are whole ſides of Streets without Inhabitants, and the poverty of the place appears ſignally in the Churches, which are mean and poorly adorned, for the ſuperſtition of <hi>Italy</hi> is ſo ravenous, and makes ſuch progreſs in this Age, that one may juſtly take the meaſures of the Wealth of any place from the Churches. The Superſtition or Vanity of this Age, is ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that of the paſt, though the contrary to this is commonly believed, that all the vaſt buildings of great Churches or rich Convents, and the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing Wealth that appears in them on Feſtival days are the donatives of the preſent Age; ſo that it is a vulgar error that ſome have taken up, who fancy that Superſtition is at a ſtand, if not in a decay, unleſs it be acknowledged that the craft of the Prieſts hath opened to them a new method to ſupport their riches, when the old ones of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and Indulgences were become leſs effectual in an Age of more knowledge, and better enlightned, and that is to engage Men to an emulation and a
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60829:69"/> vanity in enriching their Churches, as much as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Italians</hi> have in the inriching ther Palaces, ſo that as they have a pleaſure as well as a vanity in ſeeing ſo much dead Wealth in their houſes, they have tranſlated the ſame humour to their Churches: And the vanity of the preſent Age that believes little or nothing of thoſe contrivances, of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, or the like, produceth the ſame, if not grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter effects, in the building and inriching their Churches, and ſo carries it in expence and prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality from the Superſtition of the former Ages that believed every thing. But to return to <hi>Ferra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> I could not but ask all I ſaw, how it came, that ſo rich a Soil was ſo ſtrangely abandoned, ſome ſaid the Air was become ſo unhealthy, that thoſe who ſtay in it were very ſhort lived; but it is well known that Fourſcore Years ago it was well peopled; and the ill Air is occaſioned by the want of Inhabitants; for there not being people to drain the ground and to keep the Ditches clean, this makes that there is a great deal of Water that lies on the ground and rots, which infects the Air in the ſame manner as is obſerved in that vaſt and rich, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inhabited Champaign of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo that the ill Air is the effect rather than the cauſe of the diſpeopling of the <hi>Popes</hi> Dominions. The true cauſe is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of the Government, and the heavy Taxes, and frequent Confiſcations, by which the Nephews of ſeveral <hi>Popes,</hi> as they have devoured many of the Families of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> ſo they have driven away many more. And this appears more viſibly by the different ſtate, as well as the Conſtitution of <hi>Bologna,</hi> which is full of People that abound in Wealth, and as the Soil is extream rich, ſo it is cultivated with all due care. For <hi>Bologna</hi> delivered it ſelf to the Popedom upon a capitulation, by which there are many Priviledges reſerved to it: Crimes there are only puniſhed in the Perſons of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60829:69"/> thoſe who commit them, but there are no confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of Eſtates; and though the Authority, in Criminal matters, belongs to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and is man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged by a Legate and his Officers, yet the Civil Government, the Magiſtracy, and the power of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature in Civil matters, is entirely in the hands of the State: And by this regulation it is, that as the riches of <hi>Bologna</hi> amaze a ſtranger, it neither being on a Navigable River, by which it is not capable of much Trade, nor being the Center of a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty where a Court is kept; ſo the Taxes that the <hi>Popes</hi> fetch from thence, are ſo conſiderable, that he draws much more from this place of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, than from thoſe where his Authority is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited and abſolute, but that are by thoſe means al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt quite abandoned; for the greatneſs of a Prince or State riſing from the numbers of the Subjects, thoſe maxims that retain the Subjects, and that draw ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to come among them, are certainly the trueſt max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims for advancing the greatneſs of the Maſter. And I could not but with much ſcorn, obſerve the folly of ſome <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> who made uſe of this argument to ſhew the greatneſs of their Nation, that one found many <hi>Frenchmen</hi> in all places to which one could come, whereas there were no <hi>Engliſh</hi> nor <hi>Dutch,</hi> nor <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers,</hi> and very few <hi>Germans:</hi> But is juſt contrary to the right conſequence that ought to be drawn from this obſervation. It is certain, that few leave their Country, and go to ſettle elſewhere, if they are not preſſed with ſo much uneaſineſs at home that they cannot well live among their Friends and Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; ſo that a mild Government drives out no ſwarms: Whereas it is the ſure mark of a ſevere Government that weakens it ſelf, when many of the Subjects find it ſo hard to ſubſiſt at home, that they are forced to ſeek that abroad, which they would much rather do in their own Country, if Impoſitions, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeverities did not force them to change their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations.</p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:60829:70"/>
               <p>But to return to the wealth of <hi>Bologna,</hi> it appears in every corner of the Town, and all round it; though its ſcituation is not very favourable, for it lies at the foot of the <hi>Appenins</hi> on the <hi>North-ſide,</hi> and is extream cold in Winter. The houſes are built as at <hi>Padua</hi> and <hi>Bern,</hi> ſo that one walks all the Town over covered under <hi>Piazza</hi>'s; but the walks here are both higher and larger than any where elſe, there are many Noble Palaces all over the Town, and the Churches, and Convents are incredibly rich; within the Town the richeſt are the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> which is the chief houſe of the Order, where their Founders bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is laid in one of the beſt Chapels of <hi>Italy;</hi> and next to them are the <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> the <hi>Servites,</hi> the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> and the Canons Regular of St. <hi>Salvator.</hi> In this laſt there is a ſcrowl of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bible, which though it is not the tenth part of the Bible, they fancy to be the whole Bible; and they were made believe by ſome <hi>Jew,</hi> that hath no doubt ſold it at a high rate, that it was written by <hi>Ezrah</hi>'s own hand, and this hath paſt long for current; but the Manuſcript is only a fine Copy like thoſe that the <hi>Jews</hi> uſe in their Synagogues, that may be, perhaps, Three or Four Hundred Years old; that part of it on which I caſt my eye was the book of <hi>Eſther,</hi> ſo by the bulk of the ſcrowl, I judged it to be the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of thoſe ſmall books of the Old Teſtament that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſet after the Law; but thoſe of the houſe fancy they have a great treaſure in it, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſuch <hi>Jews</hi> as have ſeen it are willing to laugh at their ignorance, and ſo ſuffer them to go on in their error. The chief Church in the Town is St. <hi>Petrone</hi>'s, and there one ſees the curious and exact <hi>Meridional-line,</hi> which that rare Aſtronomer <hi>Caſſini</hi> laid along a great part of the pavement in a braſs Circle; it marks the true point of midday from <hi>June</hi> to <hi>January,</hi> and is one of the beſt performances that perhaps the World ever ſaw. In the great ſquare
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:60829:70"/> before the Church, on the one ſide of which is the Legates Palace, among other Statues one ſurprized me much, it was Pope <hi>Joans,</hi> which is ſo named by the People of the Town, it is true the Learned Men ſay it is the Statue of Pope <hi>Nicolas</hi> the IV. who had indeed a youthly and womaniſh face. But as I look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at this Statue very attentively, through a little proſpect that I carried with me, it appeared plainly to have the face of a young Woman, and was very unlike that of Pope <hi>Nicolas</hi> the IV. which is in St. <hi>Maria Maggiore</hi> at <hi>Rome:</hi> For the Statue of that Pope, though it hath no beard, yet hath an age in it that is very much different from the Statue at <hi>Bologna.</hi> I do not build any thing on this Statue, for I do not believe that Story at all, and I my ſelf ſaw in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> a Manuſcript of <hi>Martinus Polonus,</hi> who is one of the ancient Authors of this matter, which did not ſeem to be written long after the Author's time; In it this Story is not in the Text, but is added on the margin by another hand. On the Hill above <hi>Bolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gna</hi> ſtands the Monaſtery of St. <hi>Michael in Boſco,</hi> which hath a moſt charming ſcituation, and proſpect, and is one of the beſt Monaſteries in <hi>Italy;</hi> it hath many Courts, and one that is Cloiſtered, and is <hi>Octangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;</hi> which is ſo nobly painted <hi>in Freſco,</hi> that it is great pity to ſee ſuch work expoſed to the Air: All was retouched by the famous <hi>Guido Reni,</hi> yet it is now again much decayed: The <hi>Dormitory</hi> is very Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificent; the Chappel is little but very fine, and the Stalls are richly carved. On the other-ſide of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logna,</hi> in the Bottom, the <hi>Carthuſians</hi> have alſo a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rich Monaſtery: Four miles from <hi>Bologna</hi> there is a <hi>Madona</hi> of St. <hi>Lukes,</hi> and becauſe many go thither in great devotion, there is a <hi>portico</hi> a building, which is already carried on almoſt half way; it is walled towards the <hi>North,</hi> but ſtands on Pillars to the <hi>South,</hi> and is about Twelve Foot broad, and Fifteen Foot high, which is carried on very vigorouſly, for in Eight
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60829:71"/> or Ten Years the half is built, ſo that in a little time, the whole will be very probably finiſhed, and this may prove the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ginning of many ſuch like <hi>Portico</hi>'s in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> for things of this kind want only a beginning, and when they are once ſet on foot they do quickly ſpread themſelves in a Country that is ſo intirely ſubdued by ſuperſtition and the artifices of their Prieſts. In <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logna</hi> they reckon there are Seventy Thouſand Perſons. I ſaw not one of the chief glories of this place for the famous <hi>Malapighi</hi> was out of Town while I was there. I ſaw a Play there, but the Poeſie was ſo bad, the Farces ſo rude, and all was ſo ill acted, that I was not a little amazed to ſee the Company expreſs ſo great a ſatisfaction in that which would have been hiſs'd off the Stage either in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>France.</hi> From <hi>Bologna</hi> we go Eight miles in a Plain, and then we engage into that range of Hills that carry the name of <hi>Apenins,</hi> though that is ſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ctly given only to one that is the higheſt: All the way to <hi>Florence</hi> this track of Hills continues, though there are ſeveral bottoms, and ſome conſiderable little Towns in them, but all is up-hill and down-hill, and <hi>Florence</hi> it ſelf is juſt at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the laſt Hill. The high-ways all along theſe Hills are kept in ſo very good caſe, that in few of the beſt Inhabited Countries doth one find the high-ways ſo well maintained as in thoſe forſaken Mountains; but this is ſo great a paſſage that all that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it find their account in the expence they lay out upon it. On the laſt of theſe Hills, though in a little bottom, in the midſt of a Hill, ſtands <hi>Pratolino,</hi> one of the great Dukes Palaces, where the retreat in ſummer muſt be very agreeable, for the Air of thoſe Mountains is extream thin and pure. The Gardens in <hi>Italy</hi> are made at a great coſt, the Statues and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains are very rich and noble, the Grounds are well laid out, and the Walks are long and even: But as they have no Gravel to give them thoſe firm and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful walks that we have in <hi>England,</hi> ſo the conſtant
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60829:71"/> greenneſs of the Box doth ſo much pleaſe them, that they preferring the ſight to the ſmell, have their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens ſo high ſented by plots made within them, that there is no pleaſure to walk in them; they alſo lay their walks ſo between hedges, that one is much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined in them. I ſaw firſt in a Garden at <hi>Vincenza,</hi> that which I found afterwards in many Gardens in <hi>Italy,</hi> which was extream convenient, there went a courſe of Water round about the Walls, about a foot from the ground in a channel of ſtone that went along the ſide of the Wall; and in this there were-holes ſo made, that a pipe of white Iron or Wood put to them, conveyed the Water to ſuch plants, as in dry ſeaſon, needed watering; and a cock, ſet the Water a running in this courſe, ſo that without the trouble of carrying Water, one Perſon could eaſily manage the watring of a great Garden. <hi>Florence</hi> is a beautiful and noble Town, full of great Palaces, rich Churches, and ſtately Convents. The ſtreets are pav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in imitation of the old <hi>Roman</hi> highways, with great Stone bigger than our common pavement Stone, but much thicker, which are ſo hollowed in their joinings to one another, that horſes find faſtning e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to their feet: There are many Statues and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in the ſtreets, ſo that in every corner one meets with many agreeable objects. I will not entertain you with a deſcription of the great Dukes Palace and Gardens, or of the old Palace and the Gallery that joins to it, and of the vaſt Collection of Pictures, Statues, Cabinets, and other curioſities that muſt needs amaze every one that ſees them; the Plate, and in particular the Gold Plate, and the great Coach, are all ſuch extraordinary things that they would require a very copious deſcription; if that had not been done ſo often, that it were to very little purpoſe to Copy what others have ſaid; and theſe things are ſo exactly ſeen by every traveller, that I can ſay nothing that is more particular of theſe ſubjects then you will find
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60829:72"/> in the common Itineraries of all Travellers. The great Dome is a magnificent building, but the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſpiece to the great Gate is not yet made. The <hi>Cupulo,</hi> is after S. <hi>Peters,</hi> the greateſt and higheſt that I ſaw in <hi>Italy;</hi> it is Three Hundred foot high, and of a vaſt compaſs, and the whole Architecture of this Fabrick is very ſingular as well as regular. Only that which was intended to add to its beauty, leſſned it very much in my thoughts; for the Walls that are all of Marble being of white and black Marble laid in different figures and orders, looked too like a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and had not that air of nobleneſs which in my opinion becomes ſo glorious a Fabrick. The <hi>Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery</hi> that ſtands before it was a Noble <hi>Heathen</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; its Gates of braſs are the beſt of that ſort that are in the World: There are ſo many Hiſtories ſo well repreſented in <hi>bas reliefs</hi> in them, with ſo much exactneſs, the work is ſo natural and yet ſo fine, that a curious Man could find entertainment for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny days, if he would examine the three Gates of this Temple, with a critical exactneſs. The <hi>Annunciata,</hi> S. <hi>Marks,</hi> S. <hi>Croce,</hi> and S. <hi>Maria Novella,</hi> are Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of great beauty and vaſt riches; but the Church and Chappel of S. <hi>Laurence</hi> exceeds them all as much in the riches within, as it is inferior to them in the out-ſide which is quite flea'd, if I may ſo ſpeak, but on deſign to give it a rich out-ſide of Marble. In a Chappel within this Church, the Bodies of the great Dukes lie depoſited, till the famous Chappel is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. But I was much ſcandalized to ſee Statues with nudities here, which I do not remember to have ſeen any where elſe in Churches. I will not offer at a deſcription of the Glorious Chappel, which as it is without doubt the richeſt piece of building that perhaps the World ever ſaw, ſo it goes on ſo ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that though there are always many at work, yet it doth not ſeem to advance proportionably to the number of the hands that are imployed in it. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60829:72"/> the Statues that are to be in it, there is one of the <hi>Virgins</hi> made by <hi>Michael Angelo,</hi> which repreſents her grief at the Paſſion of her Bleſſed Son, that hath the moſt life in it of all the Statues I ever ſaw.</p>
               <p>But the famous Library that belongs to this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, took up more of my time than all the other Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities of <hi>Florence;</hi> for here is a collection of many Manuſcripts, moſt of them are <hi>Greek,</hi> that were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together by Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the VII. and given to his Country: There are very few Printed Books mixed with them; and thoſe Books that are there, are ſo rare, that they are almoſt as curious as Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts. I ſaw ſome of <hi>Virgils</hi> Poems in old Capitals. There is a Manuſcript in which ſome parts both of <hi>Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Apeuleius</hi> are written, and in one place, one in a different hand hath writ, that he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared thoſe Manuſcripts: and he adds a date to this in <hi>Olibrius</hi>'s time, which is above Twelve hundred Years ago. I found ſome Dipthongs in it caſt into one Letter, which ſurprized me, for I thought that way of writing of them had not been ſo ancient: but that which pleaſed me moſt, was, that the Library-keeper aſſured me, that one had lately found the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Epiſtle of St. <hi>Chriſoſtomes</hi> to <hi>Ceſarius</hi> in <hi>Greek,</hi> in the end of a Volume full of other things, and not among the Manuſcripts of that Fathers Books of which they have a great many. He thought he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred well the place where the Book ſtood; ſo we turned over all the Books that ſtood near it, but I found it not: He promiſed to look it out for me, if I came back that way. But I changing my deſign, and going back another way, could not ſee the bottom of this. It is true, the Famous <hi>Magliabecchi,</hi> who is the Great Dukes Library-keeper, and is a Perſon of moſt wonderful civility and full of candour, as well as he is learned beyond imagination, aſſured me that this could be no other than a miſtake of the Library-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; he ſaid ſuch a diſcovery could not have been
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60829:73"/> made without making ſo much noiſe that he muſt have heard of it. He added there was not one Man in <hi>Florence</hi> that either underſtood <hi>Greek,</hi> or that exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined Manuſcripts, ſo that he aſſured me I could not build on what an Ignorant Library-keeper had told me: So I ſet down this matter as I found it without building much on it. <hi>Florence</hi> is much ſunk from what it was, for they do not reckon that there are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Fifty thouſand Souls in it: and the other States that were once great Republicks, ſuch as <hi>Siena</hi> and <hi>Piſa,</hi> while they retained their liberty, are now ſhrunk almoſt into nothing: It is certain that all three together are now not ſo numerous, as any one of them was Two hundred Years ago. <hi>Legorn</hi> is full of People; and all round <hi>Florence</hi> there are a great many Villages; but as one goes over <hi>Tuſcany</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſo diſpeopled, that one cannot wonder to find a Country that hath been a Scene of ſo much action and ſo many Wars, now ſo forſaken and ſo poor, and that in many places the Soil is quite neglected for want of hands to cultivate it: and in other places where there are more People, they look ſo poor, and their houſes are ſuch miſerable ruines, that it is ſcarce ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable how there ſhould be ſo much poverty in ſo rich a Country, which is all over full of beggars: and here the ſtyle of begging was a little altered from what I found in <hi>Lombardy;</hi> for whereas there they begged for the ſake of S. <hi>Anthony,</hi> here all begged for the Souls that were in Purgatory, and this was the ſtile in all the other parts of <hi>Italy</hi> through which I paſſed. In ſhort, the diſpeopling of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> and moſt of the Principalities of <hi>Italy,</hi> but chiefly of the Popes Dominions, which are more abandoned than any other part of <hi>Italy,</hi> ſeemed to flow from nothing but the ſeverity of the Government and the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of Trade: for the greateſt Trade of <hi>Italy</hi> being in Silk, the vaſt importation of Silks that the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Companies bring into <hi>Europe,</hi> hath quite ruined all
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60829:73"/> thoſe that deal in this manufacture: Yet this is not the chief cauſe of the diſpeopling of thoſe rich Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, the ſeverity of the Taxes is the true reaſon: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all that decay of Trade, the Taxes are ſtill kept up. Beſides this, the vaſt Wealth of the Convents, where the only People of <hi>Italy</hi> are to be ſound, that live not only at their eaſe, but in great plenty and luxury, makes many forſake all ſort of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and ſeek for a retreation of thoſe ſeats of pleaſure; ſo that the People do not encreaſe faſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make a new Race to come inſtead of thoſe whom a hard Government drives away. It muſt needs ſurprize an unattentive Traveller to ſee, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Venetian</hi> Territory; which is indeed a rich Country, but the Baliages of the <hi>Switzers,</hi> and the Coaſt of <hi>Genoa</hi> ſo full of People, when <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> the Patrimony, and the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> have ſo few Inhabitants. In the Coaſt of <hi>Genoua,</hi> there is for many miles as it were a conſtant tract of Towns and Villages, and all thoſe are well peopled, though they have ſcarce any Soil at all, lying under the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that are very barren, and that expoſed them to a moſt uneaſie Sun; and that they lie upon a boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Sea that is almoſt always in a ſtorm, and that affords very few Fiſh: and yet the gentleneſs of the Government draws ſuch multitudes thither, and thoſe are ſo full of Wealth, that Money goes at Two <hi>per cent.</hi> But on the other hand to ballance this a little, ſo ſtrange and wild a thing is the nature of Man, at leaſt of <hi>Italians,</hi> that I was told that the worſt People of all <hi>Italy,</hi> are the <hi>Genoeſes,</hi> and the moſt generally corrupted in their Morals, as to all ſorts of Vice, ſo that though a ſevere Government and Slavery are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the nature of Man, and to human Society, to Juſtice and Equity; and to that eſſential equality that Nature hath made among Men: yet on the other hand, all Men cannot bear that eaſe and liberty that becometh human Nature. The ſuperſtition of <hi>Italy,</hi>

I had almoſt forgot one Remark that I made in the Hill of the <hi>Appenins,</hi> juſt above <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> that I never ſaw ſuch tall and big Cypreſſes as grew over all that Hill, which ſeemed a little ſtrange, that Tree being apt to be ſtarved by a cold Winter among us, and there the Winters are ſevere. All the way in <hi>Tuſcany</hi> is very rugged, except on the ſides of the <hi>Arne.</hi> But the uneaſineſs of the Road is much qualified by the great care that is had of the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, which are all in very good caſe: The Inns are wretched and ill furniſhed both for Lodging and Diet. This is the plague of all <hi>Italy,</hi> when once one hath paſſed the <hi>Appennins:</hi> for, except in the great Towns, one really ſuffers ſo much that way, that the pleaſure of Travelling is much abated by the inconveniences that one meets in every Stage through which he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.

               <p>I <hi>Am now in my laſt ſtage of my Voyage over</hi> Italy, <hi>for ſince my laſt from</hi> Florence, <hi>I have not only got hither, but have been in</hi> Naples; <hi>and have now ſatisfied my Curioſity ſo fully, that I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to leave this Place within a day or two, and go to</hi> Civita-vecchia, <hi>and from thence by Sea to</hi> Marſeilles, <hi>and to avoid an unpleaſant Winters Journey over the</hi> Alps. <hi>It is true I cloſe the ſight of</hi> Turin, Genoa, <hi>and ſome other Courts: but tho I am told theſe deſerve well the pains of the Journey; yet when one riſes from a great Meal, no Delicacies, how much ſoever they might tempt him at an other time can provoke his appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite: ſo I confeſs freely that the ſight of</hi> Naples <hi>and</hi> Rome, <hi>have ſo fil'd my ſtomack that way, that the Curioſity of ſeeing new Places is now very low with me, and indeed theſe that I have of laſt ſeen are ſuch, that Places which at an other time would pleaſe me much, would now make but a ſlight and cold Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All the way from <hi>Florence,</hi> through the Great Duke's Country looked ſo ſad, that I concluded it
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60829:75"/> muſt be the moſt diſpeopled of all <hi>Italy:</hi> but indeed, I changed my Note, when I came into the <hi>Popes</hi> Terriories at <hi>Pont Centino,</hi> where there was a rich bottom all uncultivated, and not ſo much as ſtocked with Cattle: But as I paſſed from M. <hi>Fiaſcone</hi> to <hi>Viterbo,</hi> this appeared yet more amazing, for a vaſt Champion Country lay almoſt quite deſerted. And that wide Town which is of ſo great a compaſs, hath yet ſo few Inhabitants, and thoſe look ſo poor and miſerable, that the people in the Ordinary Towns in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and in its worſt places make a better appearance. When I was within a days Journey of <hi>Rome,</hi> I fancied that the Neighbourhood of ſo great a City muſt mend the matt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ar: The ſurprize that this gave me, encreaſed upon me as I went out of <hi>Rome</hi> on its other ſide, chiefly all the way to <hi>Naples,</hi> and on the way to <hi>Civita-vecchia,</hi> for that vaſt and rich Champion Countrey that runs all along to <hi>Terracina,</hi> which from <hi>Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta-vecchia</hi> is above a hundred miles long, and is in many places twelve or twenty miles broad, is aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned to ſuch a degree, that as far as ones eye can carry one, there is often not ſo much as a Houſe to be ſeen; but on the Hills that are on the North-ſide of this Valley, and by this diſpeopling of the Country, the Air is now become ſo unwholeſome, that it is not ſafe to be a night in it all the Summer long, for the Water that lies upon many places not being drained, it rots: and in the Summer this produces ſo many noiſom ſteams, that it is felt even in <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf; and if it were not for the breeſes that come from the Mountains, the Air would be intollerable: When one ſees all this large but vaſt Countrey from the Hill of <hi>Marino</hi> twelve miles beyond <hi>Rome,</hi> he cannot
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60829:75"/> wonder enough at it. In a word, it is the rigour of the Governm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nt, that hath driven away the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and their being driven away, hath now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced it to ſuch a paſs, that it is hardly poſſible to people it: for ſuch as would come to drain and cultivate it, muſt run a great hazard, and few can reſolve on that, when they can hope for no other reward of their Induſtry, but an uneaſie Government. It is the greateſt ſolaeciſm in Government for the Prince to be Elective, and yet Abſolute; for an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Prince is induced to conſider his poſterity, and to maintain his people, ſo that thoſe that come after him may ſtill ſupport the rank which they hold in the World: But an Elective Prince hath nothing of that in his eye, unleſs he hath a pitch of generoſity which is not ordinary among men, and leaſt of all among <hi>Italians,</hi> who have a paſſion for their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, which is not known in other places: and thus a <hi>Pope,</hi> who comes in late to this dignity, which by conſequence he cannot hope to hold long, doth very naturally turn to thoſe Councels, by which his Family may make all the Hay they can during this Sun-ſhine: And tho anciently the <hi>Cardinals</hi> were a check upon the <hi>Pope,</hi> and a ſort of Councel without whom he could do nothing even in Temporals; yet now they have quite loſt that; and they have no other ſhare in affairs than that to which the <hi>Pope</hi> thinks fit to admit them, ſo that he is the moſt abſolute Prince in <hi>Europe.</hi> It is true as to Spirituals they retain ſtill a large ſhare, ſo that in cenſures and definitions, the <hi>Pope</hi> can do nothing regularly, without their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence; tho it is certain that they have not ſo good a Title to pretend to that, as to ſhare in the Temporal Principality. For if the <hi>Pope</hi> drives any thing from St. <hi>Peter,</hi> all that, is ſingly in himſelf, and it is free to him to pr ceed by what method he thinks beſt; ſince the Infallibility, according to their pretenſions, reſts ſingly in him: Yet becauſe there was not ſo
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60829:76"/> much to be got by acting Arbitrarily in thoſe matters, and a Summary way of exerciſing this Authority, might have tempted the World to have enquired too much into the grounds on which it is built; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Popes</hi> have let the <hi>Cardinals</hi> retain ſtill a ſhare in this Supremacy over the Church, tho they have no claim to it, neither by any Divine nor Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical warrants: But as for the endowments of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> to which they may juſtly lay claim, as being in a manner the Chapter of that See; there is ſo much to be got by this, that the <hi>Popes</hi> have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed it wholly to themſelves: and thus it is that the Government of this Principality, is very unſteady. Sometimes the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Family are extreamly glorious, and magnificent, at other times, they think of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but of eſtabliſhing their houſe: Sometimes the <hi>Pope</hi> is a man of ſenſe himſelf; Sometimes he is quite ſunk, and as the laſt <hi>Pope</hi> was, he become a Child again through old age: Sometimes he hath a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſtifneſs of temper, with a great ſlowneſs of underſtanding, and an infatiable deſire of heaping up wealth, which is the character of him that now Reigns. By this diverſity which appears eminently in every new Pontificate that commonly avoids thoſe exc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſſes that made the former Reign odious, the Councels of the <hi>Popedome</hi> are weak and disjointed. But if this is ſenſible to all <hi>Europe,</hi> with relation to the general concerns of that Body, it is much more viſible in the Principality it ſelf, that is ſubject to ſo variable a head. There hath been in this Age a ſucceſſion of four ravenous Reigns, and tho there was a ſhort interruption in the Reign of the <hi>Roſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glioſi,</hi> that coming after the <hi>Barberins,</hi> the <hi>Pamphili,</hi> and the <hi>Ghigi</hi>'s, did inrich it ſelf: and yet it diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Revenue by the vaſt magnificence in which he Reigned, more in twenty nine months time, than any other had done in ſo many years. The <hi>Altieri</hi> did, in a moſt ſcandalous manner, raiſe themſelves
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60829:76"/> in a very ſhort and diſpiſed Reign, and built one of the Nobleſt Palaces in <hi>Rome.</hi> He that Reigns now doth not indeed raiſe his Family avowedly, but he doth not eaſe the people of their Taxes: and as there is no magnificence in his Court, nor any publick buildings now carrying on at <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo the many vacant Caps, occaſion many empty Palaces: and by this means there is ſo little expence now made at <hi>Rome,</hi> that it is not poſſible for the people to live and pay the Taxes, which hath driven, as is believed, almoſt a fourth part of the Inhabitants out of <hi>Rome,</hi> during this Pontificate. And as the pre-emption of the Corn makes that there is no profit made by the Owners, out of the cultivation of the Soil, all that going wholly to the <hi>Pope,</hi> ſo there are no ways left here of employing one's Mony to any conſiderable advantage: For the publick Banks, which are all in the <hi>Pope</hi>'s hand, do not pay in effect three <hi>per cent</hi> tho they pretend to give four <hi>per cent</hi> of intereſt. The ſettlement is indeed four <hi>per cent,</hi> and this was thought ſo great an advantage, that actions on the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Bank were bought at a hundred and Sixteen the hundred. But this <hi>Pope</hi> broke through all this, and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

A man of quality at <hi>Rome,</hi> and an eminent Church-man,

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited-Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi> they would ſignifie no more towards their preſervation, than their other Provinces did: which, by their unskilful conduct they have both diſpeopled and exhauſted: Whereas by their loſing thoſe ſeven Provinces, thoſe States have fallen upon ſuch wiſe Notions of Government, and have drawn ſo much Wealth, and ſuch numbers of people together, that <hi>Spain</hi> it ſelf was now preſerved by them, and was ſaved in this Age by the loſs it made of thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces in the laſt: and thoſe States that if they had remained ſubject to <hi>Spain,</hi> would have ſignified little to its ſupport, did that now much more conſiderably by being <hi>Allies,</hi> then they could have done if they had ſhaken off their Yoak.</p>
               <p>Indeed, if <hi>Spain</hi> had been ſo happy as to have ſuch Viceroys and Governors, as it has now in <hi>Nap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60829:77"/> that he thought the late King of <hi>Spain</hi> did him in an amour, that he deſigned the blowing him up by Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, when he was in the Council Chamber: but that crime was diſcovered in time, and was not only forgiven him in conſideration of the greatneſs of his Family, he being the Son of <hi>Don Lewis de Haro:</hi> but after that he was made for ſeveral years Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor in <hi>Rome:</hi> He is now Viceroy of <hi>Naples,</hi> and is the only Governor of all the places through which I paſſed, that is, without exception beloved and eſteemed by all ſorts of people: for during the few years of his Miniſtry, he hath redreſſed ſuch abuſes that ſeemed paſt cure, and that required an Age to correct them: He hath repreſſed the inſolence of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſo much at <hi>Naples,</hi> that the Natives have no occaſion to complain of the haughtineſs of their Maſters: for he proceeds againſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with no leſs ſeverity, when they give cauſe for it, than againſt the <hi>Neapolitans:</hi> He hath taken the pay of the Souldiers ſo immediately into his own care, that they, who before his coming were half naked, and robbed, ſuch as paſſed on the ſtreets of <hi>Naples</hi> in day light, are now exactly payed, well diſciplined, and ſo decently cloathed, that it is a pleaſure to ſee them: He examines their Muſters alſo ſo exactly, that he is ſure not to be cheated by falſe liſts: He hath brought the Markets and Weights of <hi>Naples</hi> to a true exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: And whereas the Bread was generally too light, he has ſent for Loaves out of the ſeveral places of the Markets and weighed them himſelf: And by ſome ſevere puniſhment on thoſe that ſold the Bread too light, he hath brought this matter to a juſt regulation: He hath alſo brought the Courts of Judicature, that were thought generally very corrupt, to reputation aga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> a deſcent upon it: But the two things that raiſe his reputation moſt, are his Extirpating of the <hi>Banditi,</hi> and the regulation of the Coin, which he hath taken in hand. It is well enough known what a Plague the <hi>Banditi</hi> have been to the Kingdom, for they go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Troops, not only robbed the Country, but were able to reſiſt an ordinary Body of Souldiers, if they had ſet on them: Theſe travelled about, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Spoyl all the Summer long, but in Winter they were harboured by ſome of the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, who gave them Quarters: And thereby did not only protect their own Lands, but had them as ſo many Inſtruments ready to execute their Revenges on their Enemies. This was well known at <hi>Naples,</hi> and there was a Councel that had the care of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the <hi>Banditi</hi> committed to them, who as they catched ſome few, and hanged them, ſo they fined ſuch Barrons as gave them harbour; and it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that thoſe Fines amounted to near a hundred and fifty thouſand Crowns a year: And thus the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe went on; only now and then there was a little Blood let, which never went to the bottom of the Diſtemper. But when the preſent Viceroy entred upon the Government, he reſolved to extirpate all the <hi>Banditi,</hi> and he firſt let all the Barons under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that if they harboured them any more, a little Fine would not ſave them: but that he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed againſt them with the utmoſt ſeverity, and by this means the <hi>Banditi</hi> could find no Winter Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: So they betook themſelves to ſome faſtneſſes among the Hills, and reſolved to make good the Paſſes, and to accommodate themſelves the beſt they could amidſt the Mountains. The <hi>Viceroy</hi> ſent a great Body againſt them, but they defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for ſome time vigorouſly, and in one Sally they killed five hundred men: but at laſt, ſeeing that they were like to be hard preſt; and that the <hi>Viceroy</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:60829:78"/> intended to come againſt them in Perſon, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of the Terms that he offered them, which was a Pardon for what was paſt, both as to Life and Gallies, and ſix pence a day for their entertainment in Priſon during Life, or the <hi>Viceroys</hi> pleaſure; and ſo they rendred themſelves. They are kept in a large Priſon, and now and then as he ſees cauſe for it, he ſends ſome few of them up and down to ſerve in Garriſons. And thus, beyond all mens expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he finiſhed this matter in a very few months: and the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> that hath been ſo long a ſcene of Pillage and Robbery, is now ſo much changed, that in no place of <hi>Europe</hi> do the Subjects enjoy a more entire ſecurity, As for the Coin, its as all the other <hi>Spaniſh</hi> money, is ſo ſubject to clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, that the whole money of <hi>Naples</hi> is now light, and far below the true Value, ſo the <hi>Viceroy</hi> hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to redreſs this: He conſiders that the crying down of money, that paſſeth upon the Publick cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, is a robbing of thoſe in whoſe hands the money happens to be when ſuch Proclamations are put out, and therefore he takes a method that is more general, in which every one will bear his ſhare, ſo that none will be cruſhed by it. He hath laid ſome Taxes on the whole Kingdom, and hath got a great many to bring in ſome Plate to be Coined: And when he hath thus prepared ſuch a quantity, as may ſerve for the circulation that is neceſſary, he intends to call in all the old money, and to give out new money for it. Thus doth this <hi>Viceroy,</hi> ſet ſuch a Pattern to the other Miniſters of the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> that if many would follow it, the State of their affairs would be ſoon altered.</p>
               <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> is the richeſt part of all <hi>Italy:</hi> for the very Mountains that are near the half of the Soil, are fruitful, and produce either Wine or Oyl in great abundance. <hi>Apulia</hi> is a great Corn Countrey, but is exceſſive hot, and in ſome years all

The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> are the Proprietors of near the half of <hi>Apulia,</hi> and they treat their Tenants with the ſame rigour that the Barons of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom do generally uſe towards their Farmers; for the Commons here are ſo miſerably oppreſſed, that in many places they die of hunger, even amidſt the great plenty of their beſt years, for the Corn is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to <hi>Spain:</hi> but neither the <hi>Spaniards</hi> nor the <hi>Neapolitans</hi> underſtand Trade ſo well as to be their own Merchants or Carriers, ſo that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> do generally carry away the profit of this Trade. The Oyl of this Kingdom is ſtill a vaſt Trade, and the Manufacture of the Wool and Soap of <hi>England,</hi> conſum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Silk Trade is ſo low that it only ſerves themſelves, but the exportation is inconſiderable: the ſloth and lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this people renders them incapable of making thoſe advantages of ſo rich a Soil, that a more indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious ſort of people would find out: For it amazes a Stranger to ſee in their little Towns, the whole men of the Town walking in the Market places in their torn Cloaks, and doing nothing; and tho in ſome big Towns, ſuch as <hi>Capua,</hi> there is but one Inn, yet even that is ſo miſerable, that the beſt Room and Bed in it, is ſo bad, that our Footmen in <hi>England</hi> would make a grievous out-cry if they were no better lodged: nor is there any thing to be had in them: the Wine is intollerable, the Bread ill baked, no Victuals, except Pigeons, and the Oyl is rotten. In ſhort, except one carries his whole proviſion from <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Naples,</hi> he muſt reſolve to endure a good deal of miſery in the four days journey that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe two places. And this is what a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller, that ſees the riches of the ſoil, cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend: but as they have not hands enough for their Soil, ſo thoſe they have are generally too little em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, that it is no wonder to ſee their Soil produce ſo little, that in the midſt of all that abundance that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60829:79"/> Nature hath ſet before them, they are one of the pooreſt Nations of <hi>Europe.</hi> But beſides this, which I have named, the vaſt and dead wealth that is in the hands of the Churchmen, is another evident cauſe of their miſery. One that knew the State of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom well, aſſured me, that if it were divided into five parts, upon a ſtrict Survey, it would be found that the Churchmen had four parts of the five; which he made out thus, they have in Soil above the half of the whole, which is two and a half: and in Tithes and Gifts and Legacies they have one and a half more: for no man dieth without leaving a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Legacy to ſome Church or ſome Convent. The Wealth that one ſees in the City of <hi>Naples</hi> alone, paſſeth imagination; there are four and twenty Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Order of the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> of both Sexes, and two and twenty of the <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> ſeven of the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The riches of the <hi>Annunciata</hi> are prodigious: It is the greateſt Hoſpital in the World, the Revenue is ſaid to be four hundred thouſand Crowns a year: the number of the Sick is not ſo great as at <hi>Milan:</hi> Yet one convenience for their Sick I obſerved in their Galleries, which was conſiderable, that every Bed ſtood as in an <hi>Alcove,</hi> and had a Wall on both ſides ſeparating it from the Beds on both hands, and as much void ſpace of both ſides of the Bed, that the Bed it ſelf took up but half the Room. The young Children that they maintain are ſo many, that one can hardly believe the numbers that they boaſt of: for they talk of many thouſands that are not ſeen, but are at Nurſe: a great part of the Wealth of this Houſe goeth to the enriching their Church, which will be all over within cruſted with inlayings of love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Marble, in a great variety and beauty of colours:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60829:80"/> The Plate that is in the Treaſure here and in the Dome (which is but a mean building, becauſe it is ancient, but hath a Noble Chappel, and a vaſt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) and in a great many other Churches are ſo prodigious, that upon the modeſt eſtimate, the Plate of the Churches of <hi>Naples</hi> amounts to eight millions of Crowns. The new Church of the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits,</hi> that of S. <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle, and that of S. <hi>Paul</hi> are ſurprizingly rich; the Gilding and Painting that is on the Roofs of thoſe Churches have coſt millions: And as there are about a hundred Convents in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> ſo every one of theſe, if it were in another place, would be thought well worth ſeeing, tho the riches of the greater Convents here, make many of them to be leſs viſited. Every year there is a new Governour of the <hi>Annunciata,</hi> who perhaps puts in his own Pocket twenty thouſand Crowns; and to make ſome compenſation when he goeth out of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, he giveth a vaſt piece of Plate to the Houſe, a Statue for a Saint in Silver, or ſome Coloſs of a Candleſtick; for ſeveral of thoſe Pieces of Plate, are ſaid to be worth ten thouſand Crowns; and thus all the Silver of <hi>Naples</hi> becomes dead and uſeleſs: The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> are great Merchants here: their Wine Cellar is a vaſt Vault, and holds above a thouſand Hogs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, and the beſt Wine of <hi>Naples</hi> is ſold by them, yet they do not retail it out ſo ſcandalouſly as the <hi>Minims,</hi> who live on the great Square before the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roys Palace, and ſell out their Wine by retail: They pay no duty, and have extraordinary good Wine, and are in the beſt place of the Town for this retail. It is true the <hi>Neapolitans</hi> are no great Drinkers, ſo the profits of this Tavern are not ſo great as they would be in colder Countries: for here men go only in for a draught in the mornings, or when they are a thirſt. Yet the Houſe groweth extream rich, and hath one of the fineſt Chappels that is in all <hi>Naples;</hi> but the Trade ſeems very unbecoming men of that Profeſſion,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60829:80"/> and of ſo ſtrict an Order. The Convents have a very particular Priviledge in this Town; for they may buy all the Houſes that lye on either ſide, till the firſt ſtreet that diſcontinueth the Houſes; and there being ſcarce a ſtreet in <hi>Naples</hi> in which there is not a Convent; by this means, they may come to buy in the whole Town: And the progreſs that the wealth of the Clergy makes in this Kingdom, is ſo viſible, that, if there is not ſome ſtop put to it, within an Age, they will make themſelves Maſters of the whole Kingdom: It is an amazing thing to ſee ſo profound an ignorance, as Reigns among the Clergy, prevail ſo effectually, for tho all the Secular Perſons here ſpeak of them with all poſſible ſcorn, yet they are the Maſters of the Spirits of the people. The Women are infinitely ſuperſtitious, and give their Husbands no reſt, but as they draw from them great preſents to the Church. It is true, there are Societies of men at <hi>Naples</hi> of freer thoughts than can be found in any other place of <hi>Italy:</hi> The <hi>Greek</hi> learning begins to flouriſh there, and the new Philoſophy is much Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died; and there is an Aſſembly that is held in D. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph Valleta</hi>'s Library (where there is a vaſt Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of well choſen Books) compoſed by men that have a right taſte of true learning and good ſenſe: They are ill looked on by the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Viceroys Palace is no extraordinary Building, only the Stair-caſe is great: But it is now very rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furniſhed within, in Pictures and Statues: there are in it ſome Statues of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Deities of Touchſtone, that are of great value: There are no great Antiquities here, only there is an ancient <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Portico</hi> that is very Noble, before St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church: But without the City near the Church and Hoſpital of St. <hi>Gennaro,</hi> that is without the Gates, are the Noble <hi>Catacombs;</hi> which becauſe they were beyond any thing I ſaw in <hi>Italy,</hi> and to which the <hi>Catacombs</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> are not to be compared, and ſince I do nor find any account of them, in all the Books that I have yet ſeen concerning <hi>Naples,</hi> I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe them more particularly.</p>

I walked indeed a great way, and found Galleries going off in all hands without end, and whereas in the <hi>Roman Catacombs</hi> there are not above three or four rows of niches that are cut out in the Rock one over another, into which the dead bodies were laid; Here there are generally ſix or ſeven rows of thoſe niches, and they are both larger and higher; ſome niches are for Childrens bodies, and in many places there are in the Floors, as it were great Cheſts hewn out of the Rock, to lay the bones of the dead as they dried, in them; but I could ſee no marks either of a cover for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In ſome places of the Rock there is as it were a little Chappel hewen out in the Rock, that goes off from the common Gallery, and there are niches all round about; but I ſaw no marks of any Wall that ſhut in ſuch places, tho I am apt to think theſe might be burying places appropriated to particular families. There is in ſome places on the Walls and Arch, Old <hi>Moſaick</hi> work, and ſome Painting, the Colours are freſh, and the manner and Characters are <hi>Gothick,</hi> which made me conclude that this might have been done by the <hi>Normans</hi> about ſix hundred years ago, after they drove out the <hi>Saracens:</hi> In ſome places there are Palm-trees painted, and Vines in other
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60829:83"/> places. The freſhneſs of the Colours ſhews theſe could not have been done while this place was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for burying, for the ſteams and rottenneſs of the Air, occaſioned by ſo much corruption, muſt have diſſolved both Plaiſter and Colours. In one place there is a man Painted with a little beard, and <hi>Paulus</hi> is written by his head: there is another reaching him a Garland, and by his head <hi>Laud</hi> is written, and this is repeated in another place right over againſt it. In another place I found a croſs Painted, and about the upper part of it theſe Letters J. C. X.

I ſaw no more Painting, and I began to grow weary of the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60829:84"/> darkneſs, and the thick Air of the place, ſo I ſtaid not above an hour in the <hi>Catacombs.</hi> This made me reflect more particularly on the <hi>Catacombs</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> than I had done, I could imagine no reaſon why ſo little mention is made of thoſe of <hi>Naples,</hi> when there is ſo much ſaid concerning thoſe of <hi>Rome;</hi> and could give my ſelf no other account of the matter, but that it being a maxim to keep up the reputation of the <hi>Roman Catacombs,</hi> as the Repoſitories of the Reliques of the primitive <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> it would have much leſſened their credit, if it had been thought that there were <hi>Catacombs</hi> far beyond them in all reſpects, that yet cannot be ſuppoſed to have been the work of the primitive <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and indeed, nothing ſeems more evident than that theſe were the common burying places of the ancient <hi>Heathens.</hi> One enters into them without the Walls of the Towns, according to the Laws of the twelve Tables, and ſuch are the <hi>Catacombs</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> that I ſaw, which were thoſe of <hi>S. Agnes</hi> and <hi>S. Sebaſtian,</hi> the entry into them being without the Town; this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers the Law, tho in effect they run under it, for in thoſe days when they had not the uſe of the needle, they could not know which way they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on thoſe works when they were once ſo far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged under ground as to loſe themſelves. It is a vain imagination to think that the <hi>Christians,</hi> in the primitive times, were able to carry on ſuch a work; for as this prodigious digging into ſuch Rocks, muſt have been a very viſible thing by the Mountaines of Rubbiſh that muſt have been brought out, and by the vaſt number of hands that muſt have been employed in it; ſo it is abſurd to think that they could hold their <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> amidſt the annoyance of ſo much cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. I found the ſteams ſo ſtrong, that tho I am as little ſubject to vapours as moſt men, yet I had all the day long after I was in them, (which was not near an hour) a confuſion, and as it were a boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60829:84"/> in my head, that diſordered me extreamly; and if there is now ſo much ſtagnating Air there, this muſt have been ſenſible in a more eminent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable manner, while there were vaſt numbers of bodies rotting in thoſe niches. But beſides this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probability that preſents it ſelf from the nature of the thing, I called to mind a paſſage of a Letter of <hi>Cornelius</hi> that was Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> after the middle of the third <hi>Century,</hi> which is preſerved by <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his ſixth Book, <hi>Chapter</hi> 43. in which we have the State of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at that time ſet forth. There were forty ſix <hi>Presbiters,</hi> ſeven <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,</hi> as many <hi>Sub-deacons,</hi> and ninety four of the Inferiour Orders of the Clergy among them: there were alſo fifteen hundred Widows, and other poor maintained out of the publick Charities. It may be reaſonably ſuppoſed that the numbers of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> were as great when this Epiſtle was writ, as they were at any time before <hi>Conſtantine's</hi> dayes; for as this was writ at the end of that long peace, of which both <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Lactantius</hi> ſpeak, that had continued above a hundred years; ſo after this time, there was ſuch a ſucceſſion of Perſecutions that came ſo thick one upon another, after ſhort intervals of quiet, that we cannot think the numbers of the <hi>Christians</hi> increaſed much beyond what they were at this time. Now there are two particulars in this State of the Clergy, upon which one may make a probable eſtimate of the numbers of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> the one is their poor, which were but fifteen hundred, now upon an exact ſurvey, it will be found that where the poor are well looked to, their number riſes generally to be the thirtieth or fortieth part of mankind; and this may be well believed to be the proportion of the poor among the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of that Age: For as their Charity was vigorous and tender, ſo we find <hi>Celſus, Julian, Lucian, Porphiry,</hi> and others, object this to the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of that time, that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60829:85"/> their Charities to the poor drew vaſt numbers of the lower ſort among them, who made themſelves <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> that they might be ſupplied by their Brethren: So that this being the State of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> then, we may reckon the poor the thirtieth part, and ſo fifteen hundred multiplied by thirty, produce five and forty thouſand: And I am the more inclined to think that this riſes up near to the full ſum of their numbers, by the other Character of the numbers of the Clergy, for as there were forty ſix <hi>Presbyters,</hi> ſo there were ninety four of the inferior Orders, who were by two more then the double of the number of the Prieſts; and this was in a time in which the care of Souls was more exactly looked after, then it has been in the more corrupted Ages, the Clergy having then really more work on their hands, the inſtructing of their <hi>Catechumenes,</hi> the viſiting their Sick, and the ſupporting and comforting the weak, being tasks that required ſo much application, that in ſo vaſt a City as <hi>Rome</hi> was in thoſe dayes, in which it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable the <hi>Christians</hi> were ſcattered over the City, and mixed in all the parts of it, we make a conjecture that is not ill grounded, when we reckon that every <hi>Presbyter</hi> had perhaps abou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If <hi>Cornelius</hi> in that <hi>Letter</hi> ſpeaks of the numbers of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in exceſſive Terms, and if <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his <hi>Apologetick</hi> hath alſo ſet out the numbers of the

                  <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of his time, in a very high ſtrain, that is only to be aſcribed to a pompous Eloquence, which diſpoſeth people to magnifie their own party; and we muſt allow a good deal to a hyperbole that is very natural to all that ſet forth their forces in general Terms. It is true, it is not ſo clear when thoſe vaſt cavities were dug out of the Rocks. We know that when the Laws of the twelve Tables were made, ſepulture was then in uſe: and <hi>Rome</hi> being then grown to a vaſt bigneſs, no doubt they had repoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories for their dead; ſo that ſince none of the <hi>Roman</hi> Authors mention any ſuch work, it may not be unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to Imagine that theſe Vaults had been wrought and cut out from the firſt beginnings of the City, and ſo th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It is alſo certain, that tho burning came to be in uſe among the <hi>Romans,</hi> yet they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned back to their firſt cuſtome of burying bodies long before <hi>Constantines</hi> time; ſo that it was not the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion that produced this change: All our modern Writers take it for granted that the change was made in the times of the <hi>Antonines;</hi> yet there being no Law made concerning it, and nu mention being made in an Age, full of Writers, of any orders that were given for burying places, <hi>Velſerus's</hi> opinion ſeems more probable, that the cuſtome of burning wore out by degrees, and ſince we are ſure that they once buryed, it is more natural to think that the ſlaves and the meaner ſort of people were ſtill buried, that being a leſs expence, and a more ſimple way of beſtowing their bodies <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I could not for ſome time find out upon what grounds the Modern Criticks take it for granted, that burying began in the times of the <hi>Antonines,</hi> till I
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60829:86"/> had the happineſs to talk of this matter with the learned <hi>Gronovius,</hi> who ſeems to be ſuch a Maſter of all the Antient learning, as if he had the Authors lying alwayes open before him: He told me, that it was certain the change from burning to burying was not made by the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Emperours, for <hi>Macrobius,</hi> (lib. 7. chap. 7.) ſayes, in plain terms, that the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of burning the Bodies of the Dead was quite worn out in that Age, which is a clear Intimation that it was not laid aſide ſo late as by <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and as there was no Law made by him on that head, ſo he, and the ſucceeding Emperours, gave ſuch an entire tolleration to <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> admitting thoſe of that Religion to the greateſt Imployments, that it is not to be imagined that there was any order given againſt burning; ſo that it is clear the <hi>Heathens</hi> had changed it of their own accord, otherwayes we ſhould have found that among the complaints that they made of the grievances, under which they lay from the <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> but it is more difficult to fix the time when this change was made. <hi>Gronovius</hi> ſhewed me a paſſage of <hi>Phlegons,</hi> that mentions the Bodies that were laid in the ground, yet he did not build on that, for it may have relation to the cuſtoms of burying that might be elſewhere. And ſo <hi>Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> gives the account of the burial of the <hi>Epheſian</hi> Matrons Husband: but he made it apparent to me, that burying was commonly practiſed in <hi>Commodus</hi>'s time; for <hi>Xiphilinus</hi> tells us, that in <hi>Pertinax</hi>'s time the friends of thoſe whom <hi>Commodus</hi> had ordered to be put to Dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The ſame Author alſo tells us, that <hi>Pertinax</hi> buried <hi>Commodus</hi>'s Body, and ſo ſaved it from the rage of the peop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tiſe of that time. It is true, it is very probable that as we ſee ſome of the <hi>Roman</hi> Families continued
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60829:86"/> to bury their dead, ev'n when burning was the more common cuſtome, ſo, perhaps, others continued af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this to burn their dead, the thing being Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and no Law being made about it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was particularly objected to the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this time, that they abhorred the cuſtome of burning the Bodies of the Dead, which is mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by <hi>Minutius Felix,</hi> but this, or any other evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, that may be brought from Meddals of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations after this time, will only prove that ſome were ſtill burnt, and that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> practiſed burying Univerſally, as expreſſing their belief of the Reſurrection; whereas the <hi>Heathens</hi> held the thing indifferent. It is alſo clear from the many genuine Inſcriptions that have been found in the <hi>Catacombs,</hi> which bear the dates of the Conſuls, that theſe were the common Burial places of all the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of the fourth and fifth <hi>Century;</hi> for I do not remember that there is any one date that is Antienter, and yet not one of the Writers of thoſe Ages ſpeak of them as the work of the Primitive <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> They ſpeak indeed of the Burial places of the Martyrs, but that will prove no more but that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> might have had their Quarters, and their Walks in thoſe common Burial places where they laid their Dead, and which might have been known among them, tho it is not likely that they would in times of perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons make ſuch Inſcriptions as might have expoſed the Bodies of their dead Friends to the rage of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.

I thought this deſerved a large Diſcourſe, and therefore I have dwelt perhaps a little too long on this Subject. I will not enter upon a long Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that which is ſo well known as Mount <hi>Veſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio,</hi> it had roared ſo loud about a month before I came to <hi>Naples,</hi> that at <hi>Naples</hi> they could hardly ſleep in the Nights, and ſome old Houſes were ſo ſhaken by the Earthquake that was occaſioned by this convulſion of the Hill, that they fell to the ground: And the laſt eruption, above fifty years ago, was ſo terrible, that there was no ſmall fear in <hi>Naples,</hi> tho it lies at the diſtance of ſeven miles from the Hill, yet the Storm was choaked under ground; for tho it ſmoakt much more than ordinary, yet there was no eruption: It was, indeed, ſmoaking not only in the mouth of the little Mount that is formed within the great waſt that the Fire hath made, but alſo all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the bottom, that is between the outward mouth of this Mountain, which is four miles in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs; and that inward Hill.

It is a Noble Monument of the profuſe and extravagant expence of a Brutal Tyrant, who made one of the vaſteſt Brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that ever was attempted over three or four miles of Sea, meerly to Sacrifice ſo great a Treaſure to his vanity: As for <hi>Agripina</hi>'s Tomb, it is no great matter, only the bas reliefs are yet en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Having thus told you what I found moſt conſiderable in <hi>Naples,</hi> I cannot paſs by that Noble remnant of the <hi>Via Appia</hi> that runs along thirty miles of the way between it and <hi>Rome,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making ſome mention of it: this high-way is twelve foot broad, all made of huge ſtones, moſt of them blew, and they are generally a foot and half large on all ſides: the ſtrength of this cauſe-way appears in its long duration, for it hath laſted above eighteen hundred Years: and is in moſt places for ſeveral miles together, as intire as when it was firſt made: and the botches that have been made for mending ſuch places, that have been worn out by time, ſhews a very viſible difference between the Ancient and the Modern way of Paving.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60829:90"/> chiefly made for ſuch as go on foot: for as nothing is more pleaſant then to walk along them, ſo nothing is more inconvenient for Horſes and all ſorts of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and indeed Mulets are the only beaſts of bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then that can hold out long in this Road, which beats all Horſes after they have gone it a little while. There are ſeveral reſts of <hi>Roman</hi> Antiquities at the Mole of <hi>Cajeta;</hi> but the Iſle of <hi>Caprea,</hi> now called <hi>Crapa,</hi> which is a little way into the Sea off from <hi>Naples,</hi> gave me a ſtrange <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Tiberius's</hi> Reign, ſince it is hard to tell whether it was more extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary to ſee a Prince abandon the beſt Seats and Palaces of <hi>Italy,</hi> and ſhut himſelf up in a little Iſland, in which I was told there was a Tradition of ſeven little Palaces that he built in it; or to ſee ſo vaſt a body as the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire ſo governed by ſuch a Tyrannical Prince, at ſuch a diſtance from the chief Scene, ſo that all might have been reverſed long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the news of it could have been brought to him. And as there is nothing more wonderfull in Story then to ſee ſo vaſt a State that had ſo great a ſenſe of liberty, ſubdued by ſo brutal and ſo volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous a man as <hi>Anthony,</hi> and ſo raw a youth as <hi>Augustus;</hi> ſo the wonder is much improved when we ſee a Prince at a hundred and fifty miles diſtance, ſhut up in an Iſland, carry the Reins of ſo great a body in his hand, and turn it which way he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>But now I come to <hi>Rome,</hi> which as it was once the Empreſs of the World in a ſucceſſion of many Ages, ſo hath in it at preſent more curious things to entertain the attention of a <hi>Traveller,</hi> then any other place in <hi>Europe.</hi> On the ſide of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> the entry in to <hi>Rome</hi> is very ſurprizing to ſtrangers, for one cometh along for a great many miles, upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of the <hi>Via Flamminia,</hi> which is not indeed ſo entire as the <hi>Via Appia:</hi> yet there is enough left to raiſe a juſt <hi>Idea</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> greatneſs, who laid

And within the Gate of the <hi>Porta di Populo,</hi> there is a Noble <hi>Obelisk,</hi> a vaſt Fountain, two fine little Churches, like two Twins reſembling one another, as well as placed near one another, and on ſeveral hands one ſees a long <hi>Viſta</hi> of ſtreets. There is not a Town in theſe parts of the World, where the Churches, Convents, and Palaces are ſo Noble, and where the other Buildings are ſo mean, which indeed, diſcovers very viſibly the miſery under which the <hi>Romans</hi> groan.

The Flooring of the Palaces is all of Brick; which is ſo very-mean, that one ſees the diſproportion that is between the Floors and the reſt of the Room, not without a ſenſible preception and diſlike. It is true, they ſay, their Air is ſo cold and moiſt in Winter that they cannot pave with Marble; and the heat is ſometimes ſo great in Summer, that Flooring of Wood would crack
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60829:92"/> with heat, as well as be eat up by the vermin that would neſtle in it. But if they kept in their great Palaces ſervants to waſh their Floors, with that care that is uſed in <hi>Holland,</hi> where the Air is moiſter, and the climate is more productive of Vermine, they would not find ſuch effects from wooden Floors, as they pretend. In a word, there are none that lay out ſo much wealth all at once, as the <hi>Italians</hi> do upon the Building and Finiſhing of their Palaces and Gardens, and that afterwards, beſtow ſo little on the preſerving of them: another thing I obſerved in their Palaces, there is, indeed, a great ſeries of Noble rooms one within another, of which their apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are compoſed, but I did not find, at the end of the apartments, where the Bed Chamber is, ſuch a diſpoſition of rooms for back-ſtairs, dreſſing-rooms, cloſets, ſervants rooms, and other conveniences as are neceſſary for accommodating the Apartment. It is true, this is not ſo neceſſary for an apartment of State, in which Magnificence is more conſidered then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience; but I found the ſame want in thoſe apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in which they lodged; ſo that notwithſtanding all the riches of their Palaces, it can not be ſaid that they are well lodged in them, and their Gardens are yet leſs underſtood, and worſe kept then their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces. It is true, the <hi>Villa Borgheſe</hi> ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, where as there is a prodigious collection of <hi>bas reliefs,</hi> with which the Walls are, as it were, covered all over, that are of a vaſt value; ſo the ſtatues within, of which ſome are of Porphiry, and others of Touchſtone, are amazing things: The whole grounds of this Park, which is about three miles in compaſs, and in which there are ſix or ſeven lodges, are laid out ſo ſweetly, that I thought I was in an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Park when I walked over it. The <hi>Villa Pamphilia</hi> is better ſcituated upon a higher ground, and hath more Water-works, and twice the extent of the other in Soil, but neither doth the

But for the Furniture of the Palaces of <hi>Rome,</hi> the publick apartments are all covered over with Pictures and for thoſe apartments in which they lodge they are generally furniſhed either with red Velvet, or red Damask, with a broad gold Galloon at every breadth of the ſtuff, and a gold Fringe at top and bottom, but there is very little Tapiſtry in <hi>Italy.</hi>

I know the hand and way of writing of that Age too well to be eaſily miſtaken in my judgement concerning thoſe Manuſcripts but if thoſe words are wanting, there are other words in them that ſeem to be much ſtronger for the ſuperiority of the Council above that <hi>Pope.</hi> For it is Decreed, that <hi>Popes,</hi> and all other perſons, were bound to ſubmit to the deciſions of the Council, as to Faith: which words are not in the <hi>French</hi> Manuſcripts: Upon this I told <hi>M.

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60829:95"/> that the World hath yet ſeen, but it is not yet Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: He is not ſo much eſteemed in <hi>Rome</hi> as he would be elſewhere, for his Learning is not in vogue, and the School Divinity and Caſuiſtical Learning, being that for which Divines are moſt eſteemed there; He whoſe Studies lead him another way, is not ſo much valued as he ought to be, and perhaps, the ſmall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that the Pope makes of learned men, turns ſomewhat upon the Confeſſor, for it is certain, that this is a Reign in which Learning is very little encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged.</p>
               <p>Upon the general contempt that all the <hi>Romans</hi> have, for the preſent <hi>Pontificate,</hi> one made a pleaſant reflection to me, he ſaid thoſe Popes that intended to raiſe their Families, as th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, or their Reign to poſterity; and it is very plain, that the preſent Pope taketh no great care of this. His life hath been certainly very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and free of all thoſe publick ſcandals that make a noiſe in the World, and there is at preſent a regularity in <hi>Rome,</hi> that deſerveth great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, for publick Vices are not to be ſeen there: His perſonal ſobriety is a ſo ſingular. One aſſured me that the expence of his Table did not

               <p>And here one thing cometh into my mind, which perhaps is not ill grounded, that the poverty of a Nation, not only diſpeoples it, by driving the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple out of it, but by weakning the natural fertility of the Subjects; for as men and women well cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and well fed, that are not exhauſted with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual labour, and with the tearing anxieties that want brings with it, muſt be much more lively then thoſe that are preſſed with want; ſo it is very likely that the one muſt be much more diſpoſed to pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Agnus,</hi> which is the entireſt and the leaſt altered of all the Ancient Temples: The great Temple of Peace; thoſe of the Sun and Moon: that of <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Romus,</hi> (which I conſidered as the ancienteſt Fabrick that is now left, for it is little and ſimple, and ſtandeth in ſuch a place, that when <hi>Rome</hi> grew ſo coſtly, it could not have been let alone unchanged, if it had not been that it was reverenced for its Antiquity) the many other <hi>Portico's,</hi> the Arches of <hi>Severus,</hi> of <hi>Titus,</hi> and <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> in the laſt of which, one ſees that the Sculpture of his age, was much ſunck from what it had been, only in the Top there are ſome <hi>bas reliefs</hi> that are clearly of a much ancienter time, and of a better manner. And that which exceedeth all the reſt, the many great <hi>Aqueducts</hi> that come from all hands and run over a vaſt diſtance, are things which a man cannot ſee oft enough, if he would form in himſelf a juſt <hi>Idea</hi> of the vaſtneſs of that Republick, or rather Empire: There are many Statues and Pillars, and other Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities of great value dug up in all the quarters of <hi>Rome</hi> theſe laſt hundred and fourſcore years, ſince <hi>Pope Leo</hi> the Xs. time; who as he was the greateſt Patron of Learning and Arts, that perhaps, ever was, ſo was the generouſeſt Prince that ever Reigned; and it was he that firſt ſet on foot the inquiring into the Riches of Old <hi>Rome,</hi> that lay till his time, for the moſt part, hid under ground; and indeed if he had been leſs ſcandalous in his Impiety and Atheiſm, of which neither he nor his Court were ſo much as aſhamed, he had been one of the moſt celebrated perſons of any Age. Soon after him <hi>Pope Paul</hi> the III. gave the ground of the <hi>Monte Palatino</hi> to his Family: But I was told that this large piece
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60829:99"/> of ground, in which one ſhould look for the greateſt Collection of the Antiquities of the higheſt value, ſince this is the ruin of the Palace of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, hath never been yet ſearched into with any exactneſs: So that when a curious Prince cometh that is willing to employ many hands in digging up and down this Hill, we may expect new Scenes of <hi>Roman</hi> Antiquities. But all this matter would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire Volumes, and therefore I have only named theſe things, becauſe I can add nothing to thoſe copious deſcriptions that have been ſo oft made of them. Nor will I ſay any thing of the modern Palaces or the Ornaments of them, either in Pictures or Statues, which are things that carry one ſo far, that it is not eaſie to give bounds to the diſcriptions into which one findeth himſelf carried, when he once enters upon ſo fruitful a ſubject. The number of the Palaces is great, and every one of them hath enough to fix the attention of a Traveller, till a new one drives the former out of his thoughts: It is true, the <hi>Paleſtrina,</hi> the <hi>Borgheſe,</hi> and the <hi>Farneſe,</hi> have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in them that leave an impreſſion which no new objects can wear out: and as the laſt hath a Noble ſquare before it with two great Fountains in it, ſo the Statue of <hi>Hercules</hi> and the <hi>Bull</hi> that are below, and the Gallery above Stairs are unvaluable, the Roof of the Gallery is one of the beſt Pieces of Painting that is extant, being all of <hi>Carrachio</hi>'s hand, and there are in that Gallery the greateſt number of Heads of the <hi>Greek</hi> Philoſophers and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets that I ever ſaw together: That of <hi>Homer,</hi> and that of <hi>Socrates,</hi> were the two that ſtruck me moſt, chiefly the latter, which as it is, without diſpute, a true Antick, ſo it carrieth in it all the characters that <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Xenophon</hi> give us of <hi>Socrates;</hi> the flat Noſe, the broad Face, the ſimplicity of Look, and the mean appearance which that great Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60829:99"/> made, ſo that I could not return oft enough to look upon it, and was delighted with this more then with all the wonders of the <hi>Bull,</hi> which is indeed a Rock of Marble cut out into a whole Scene of Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; but as the Hiſtory of it is not well known, ſo there are ſuch Faults in the Sculpture, that tho it is all extream fine, yet one ſeeth it hath not the exactneſs of the beſt times. As for the Churches and Convents of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the number, the vaſtneſs, the riches, both of Fabrick, Furniture, Painting and other Ornaments amaze one, ſo here again a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is loſt, and the Convent that one ſeeth laſt, is alwayes the moſt admired: I confeſs the <hi>Minerva,</hi> which is the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> where the Inquiſition ſif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieth, is that which maketh the moſt ſenſible Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon one that paſſeth at <hi>Rome</hi> for an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, tho except one committeth great follies, he is in no danger there, and the poverty that reigns in that City maketh them find their intereſt ſo much in uſing Strangers well, whatſoever their Religion may be, that no man needs be affraid there: And I have more then ordinary reaſon to ackowledge this who having ventured to go thither, after all the liberty that I had taken to write my thoughts free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly both of the Church and See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and was known by all with whom I converſed there, yet met with the higheſt civilities poſſible among all ſorts of people, and in particular, both among the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scottiſh Jeſuites,</hi> tho they knew well enough that I was no friend to their Order.</p>
               <p>In the Gallery of the <hi>Engliſh Jeſuites,</hi> among the Pictures of their Martyrs, I did not meet with <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net;</hi> for perhaps that name is ſo well known, that they would not expoſe a Picture, with ſuch a name on it, to all Strangers, yet <hi>Oldcorn,</hi> being a name leſs known, is hung there among their Martyrs, tho he was as clearly convicted of the Gun-pouder
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60829:100"/> Treaſon, as the other was: and it ſeemed a little ſtrange to me, to ſee that at a time in which, for other reaſons, the Writers of that Communion have not thought fit, to deny the truth of that Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, a <hi>Jeſuit</hi> convicted of the blackeſt crime that ever was projected, ſhould be reckoned among their Martyrs. I ſaw likewiſe there the Original of theſe Emblematical Prophecies, relating to <hi>England,</hi> that the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> have had at <hi>Rome</hi> near ſixty years, and of which I had ſome time ago procured a Copy, ſo I found my Copy was true. I hapned to be at <hi>Rome,</hi> during St. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Fair and Feaſt, which laſted ſeveral dayes. In his Church the <hi>Hoſty</hi> was expoſed: and from that, all that came thither, went to the Chappel that was once his Houſe, in which his Statue and the Table where he ſerved the poor, are preſerved: I ſaw ſuch vaſt numbers of people there, that one would have thought all <hi>Rome</hi> was got to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. They all kneeled down to his Statue, and after a prayer ſaid to it, they kiſſed his foot, and every one touched the Table with his Beads, as hoping to draw ſome vertue from it. I will add nothing of the ſeveral Obelisks and Pillars that are in <hi>Rome,</hi> of the celebrated Chappels that are in ſome of the great Churches, in particular thoſe of <hi>Sixtus</hi> the V. and <hi>Paul</hi> the V. in <hi>Santa Maria Maggiore,</hi> of the Water works in the <hi>Quirinal,</hi> the <hi>Vatican,</hi> and in many of the Vineyards: Nor will I go out of <hi>Rome</hi> to deſcribe <hi>Freſcati,</hi> (for <hi>Tivoly</hi> I did not ſee) The young Prince <hi>Borgeſe,</hi> who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed one of the glories of <hi>Rome,</hi> as well for his Learning as for his Virtue, did me the Honour to carry me thither with thoſe two learned Abbots <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bretri</hi> and <hi>Nazari,</hi> and entertained me with a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence that became him better to give, than me to receive. The Water-works in the <hi>Aldobrandin</hi> Palace have a magnificence in them beyond all that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60829:100"/> I ever ſaw in <hi>France,</hi> the mixture of Wind with the Water, and the Thunders and Storms that this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth is noble: The Water-works of the <hi>Ludoviſio,</hi> and the <hi>Monte Dragone,</hi> have likewiſe a greatneſs in them that is natural, and indeed the riches that one meets with in all places within Doors in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the poverty that one ſeeth every where abroad, are the moſt unſuitable things imaginable: but it is very likely that a great part of their moveable Wealth will be ere long carried into <hi>France;</hi> for as ſoon as any Picture or Statue of great value is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to be ſold, thoſe that are imployed by the King of <hi>France,</hi> do preſently buy it up, ſo that as that King hath already, the greateſt collection of Pictures that is in <hi>Europe,</hi> he will very probably in a few years more, bring together the chief Treaſures of <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have now given you an account of all that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared moſt remarkable to me in <hi>Rome.</hi> I ſhall to this add a very extraordinary piece of Natural Hiſtory, that fell out there within theſe two years, which I had firſt from thoſe two learned Abbots <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bretti</hi> and <hi>Nazari,</hi> and that was afterwards more authentically confirmed to me by Cardinal <hi>Howard,</hi> who was one of the Congregation of Cardinals that examined and judged the matter. There were two Nuns near <hi>Rome,</hi> one as I remember was in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the other not far from it, who, after they had been for ſome years in a Nunnery, perceived a very ſtrange change in Nature, and that their Sex was altered, which grew by ſome degrees a total alteration in one: and tho the other was not ſo entire a change, yet it was viſible ſhe was more Man than Woman; upon this the matter was look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into: That which naturally offereth it ſelf here, is that theſe two had been alwayes what they then appeared to be; but that they had gone into a Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60829:101"/> in a diſguiſe to gratifie a brutal appetite. But to this, when I propoſed it, anſwer was made, that as the breaſts of a Woman that remained ſtill, did in a great meaſure ſhake off that objection, ſo the proofs were given ſo fully of their having been real females, that there was no doubt left of that, nor had they given any ſort of ſcandal in the change of their Sex; And if there had been any room left to ſuſpect a cheat or diſguiſe, the proceedings would have been both more ſevere and more ſecret: and theſe perſons would have been burnt, or at leaſt put to death in ſome terrible manner. Some Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians and Chyrurgions were appointed to examine the matter, and at laſt, after a long and exact enquiry, they were judged to be abſolved from their vows, and were diſmiſſed from the obligation of a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious life, and required to go in mens habit. One of them was a Valet de Chambre to a <hi>Roman</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, when I was there: I heard of this matter only two dayes before I left <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo that I had not time to enquire after it more particularly; but I judged it ſo extraordinary, that I thought it was worth communicating it to ſo curious an Inquirer into nature.</p>
               <p>And ſince I am upon the ſubject of the changes that have been made in nature, I ſhall add one of another ſort that I examined while I was at <hi>Geneva.</hi> There is a Miniſter of S. <hi>Gervais,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gody,</hi> who hath a Daughter, that is now Sixteen years old: Her Nurſe had an extraordinary thickneſs of hearing, at a year old, the Child ſpoke all thoſe little words that Children begin uſually to learn at that age, but ſhe made no progreſs; yet this was not obſerved, till it was too late, and as ſhe grew to be two years old, they perceived there that ſhe had loſt her hearing, and was ſo deaf that ever ſince tho ſhe hears great noiſes, yet ſhe hears nothing that one can
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60829:101"/> ſpeak to her. It ſeems while the milk of her Nurſe, was more abundant, and that the Child ſuckt more moderately the firſt year, thoſe humors in the blood and milk had not that effect on her, that appeared after ſhe came to ſuck more violently: and that her Nurſes milk being in leſs quantity, was thicker, and more charged with that vapour that occaſioned the deafneſs. But this Child hath by obſerving the motions of the mouths and lips of others, acquired ſo many words, that out of theſe ſhe hath formed a ſort of <hi>jargon,</hi> in which ſhe can hold converſation whole days with thoſe that can ſpeak her own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. I could underſtand ſome of her words, but could not comprehend a period, for it ſeemed to be a confuſed noiſe: She knows nothing that is ſaid to her, unleſs ſhe ſeeth the motion of their mouths that ſpeak to her; ſo that in the night, when it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſpeak to her, they muſt light a Candle: Only one thing appeared the ſtrangeſt part of the whole narration: She hath a Siſter with whom ſhe has practiſed her Language more than with any other: and in the night by laying her hand on her Siſters mouth, ſhe can perceive by that, what ſhe ſayes, and ſo can diſcourſe with her in the Night. It is true, her Mother told me that this did not go far, and that ſhe found out only ſome ſhort period in this manner, but it did not hold out very long: Thus this young Woman without any pains taken on her, hath meerly by a natural ſagacity found out a method of holding diſcourſe, that doth in a great meaſure leſſen the miſery of her deafneſs. I examined this matter critically, but only the Siſter was not preſent, ſo that I could not ſee how the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation paſt between them in the dark.</p>
               <p>But before I give over writting concerning this place, I cannot hinder my ſelf, from giving you an account of a converſation that I had with one of the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60829:102"/> moſt Celebrated perſons that lives in it. I was talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concerning the credit that the Order of the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites</hi> had every where; It was ſaid that all the World miſtruſted them, and yet by a ſtrange ſort of contradiction all the World truſted them, and tho it was well known that every <hi>Jeſuite</hi> was truer to the Intereſts of his Order, than he could be to the Intereſts of any Prince whatſoever, yet thoſe Princes that would be very careful not to ſuffer ſpies to come into their Courts or into their Councils ſuffered thoſe ſpies to come into their breaſts and Conſciences: and tho Princes were not generally very tender in thoſe parts, yet as they had oft as much guilt, ſo they had ſometimes as much fear as other People, which a Dextrous ſpy knew well how to mannage: Upon which that perſon that pretended to be a zealous Catholick, added, that for their part they conſidered only the Character that the Church gave to a Prieſt; and if the Church qualified him to do the functions of a Prieſt, they thought it very need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to inquire after other perſonal Qualities, which were but common things, whereas the other was all Divine. On the Contrary, they thought it was ſo much the better to have to do with a poor Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Prieſt: for then they had to do only with the Church, and not with the man. Purſuant to this, that perſons Confeſſor was the greateſt and the moſt notorious block head that could be found, and when they were asked why they made uſe of ſo weak a Man, they anſwered, becauſe they could not find a weaker: and when ever they found one better qualified that way, if it were a groom or a foot-man that got into Prieſt's Orders, they would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly make uſe of him. For they would ask Council of a friend; but they knew no other uſe of a Confeſſor, but to Confeſs to him, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Abſolution from him: and in ſo doing, they
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60829:102"/> pretended they acted as became a true Catholick, that conſidered only the power of the Church in the Prieſt, without regarding any thing elſe.</p>
               <p>So far have I entertained you with the ſhort ramble that I made, which was too ſhort to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the name of Travelling, and therefore the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries or Obſervations that I could make, muſt be received with the abatement that ought to be made for ſo ſhort a ſtay: and all will be of a piece, when the remarks are as ſlight, as the abode I made in the places through which I paſt was ſhort. I have avoided the troubling you with things that are commonly known, ſo if I have not entertained you with a long recital of ordinary matters, yet I have told you nothing but what I ſaw and knew to be true, or that I had from ſuch hands, that I have very good reaſon to believe it: and I fancy that the things which made the greateſt impreſſion on my ſelf, will be acceptably received by you, to whom, as upon many accounts, I owe all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of eſteem and gratitude that I can ever pay; ſo I had a more particular reaſon that deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined me to give you, ſo full an account of all I ſaw and obſerved: for as you were pleaſed at par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to do me the Honour to deſire me to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to you ſuch things as appeared moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to me, ſo I found ſuch a vaſt advantage in many places, but more particularly at <hi>Venice, Rome</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> by the happineſs I have of being known to you, and of being ſo far conſidered by you, that I could give a Copious Account both of your perſon and Studies, to thoſe in whom your curious diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries had kindled that eſteem for you, which all the World payeth both to you and to your immortal enquiries into nature, which are among the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar bleſſings of this Age: and that are read with no leſs care and pleaſure in <hi>Italy</hi> then in <hi>England.</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:60829:103"/> This was ſo well received, that I found the great advantage of this Honour I did my ſelf, in aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the glorious Title of one of your friends, and I owe a great part of that diſtinction which I met with, to this favourable character that I gave my ſelf; ſo that if I made any progreſs in the enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that ſo ſhort a ſtay could enable one to make, I owe it in ſo a peculiar a manner to you, that this return that I make is but a very ſmall part of that I owe you, and which I will be endeavouring to pay you to the laſt moment of my life.</p>

               <p>I Thought I had made ſo full a point at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of my laſt Letter, that I ſhould not have given you the trouble of reading any more Letters of the Volume of the former: But new Scenes and new Matter offering themſelves to me, I fancy you will be very gentle to me, if I Engage you again to two or three Hours reading. From <hi>Civita Vec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia</hi> I came to <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> where if there were a Road as Safe as the Harbour is covered; and if the Harbour were as large as it is convenient, it were certainly one of the moſt important places in the World; all is ſo well defended, that it is with reſpect either to Storms or Enemies the ſecureſt Port that can be ſeen any where. The Freedoms of this place, though it is now at the mercy of the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60829:105"/> are ſuch, and its ſcituation draweth ſo much Trade to it, that there one ſeeth another appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of wealth then I found in any Town of <hi>France,</hi> and there is a new ſtreet lately built there, that for the beauty of the buildings, and the largeneſs of the ſtreet, is the Nobleſt I ever ſaw. There is in that Port a perpetual heat, and the Sun was ſo ſtrong in the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> week, that I was often dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven off the Key. I made a Tour from thence through <hi>Provence, Languedoc,</hi> and <hi>Dauphinè.</hi> I will offer you no account of <hi>Niſmes,</hi> nor of the <hi>Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theatre</hi> in it, or the <hi>Pont du Gar</hi> near it; which as they are ſtupendious things, ſo they are ſo copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly deſcribed by many, and are ſo generally known to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, that if you have never gone that way your ſelf, yet you muſt needs have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſo particular a relation of them from thoſe that have ſeen them on their way to <hi>Montpelier,</hi> that I judge it needleſs to enlarge upon them: Nor will I ſay any thing of the Soil, the Towns, or any other remarkable things that I found there.</p>
               <p>I have a much ſtronger inclination to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, concerning the perſecution which I ſaw in its rage and utmoſt fury; and of which I could give you many inſtances that are ſo much beyond all the common meaſures of barbarity and cruelty, that I confeſs they ought not to be believed, unleſs I could give more poſitive proofs of them, than are fitting now to be brought forth: and the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars that I could tell you are ſuch, that if I ſhould relate them with the neceſſary circumſtances of time, place, and perſons, theſe might be ſo fatal to many that are yet in the power of their Enemies, that my regard to them reſtrains me. In ſhort I do not think that in any Age there ever was ſuch a violation of all that is ſacred, either with relation to God or Man: And what I ſaw and knew there
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60829:105"/> from the firſt hand, hath ſo confirmed all the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi>'s that I had taken from Books of the cruelty of that Religion, that I hope the impreſſion that this hath made upon me ſhall never end but with my life: The applauſes that the whole Clergy give to this way of proceeding, the many Panegyricks that are already writ upon it, of which, beſides the more pompous ones that appear at <hi>Paris,</hi> there are numbers writ by ſmaller Authors in every Town of any note there; and the Sermons that are all flights of flattery upon this ſubject, are ſuch evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent demonſtrations of their ſenſe of this matter; that what is now on foot may be well term<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d the Act of the whole Clergy of that Kingdom, which yet hath been hitherto eſteemed the moſt moderate part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion. If any are more moderate than others; and have not ſo far laid off human nature as not to go in entirely into thoſe bloody practiſes, yet they dare not own it, but whiſper it in ſecret as if it were half Treaſon: but for the greater part, they do not only magnifie all that is done, but they animate even the <hi>Dragoons</hi> to higher degrees of rage: and there was ſuch a heat ſpread over all the Country, on this occaſion, that one could not go into any Ordinary, or mix in any promiſcuous converſation, without finding ſuch ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it, that it was not eaſie for ſuch as were toucht with the leaſt degree of compaſſion for the miſeries that the poor <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſuffered, to be a witneſs to the Inſultings that they muſt meet with in all places. Some perhaps imagine that this hath not been approved in <hi>Italy,</hi> and it is true there were not any publick rejoycings upon it at <hi>Rome;</hi> no Indulgences nor <hi>Te Deums</hi> were heard of: And the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> faction being ſo prevalent there, it is not ſtrange if a courſe of proceedings, that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an example, was ſet forth, by all that were of that intereſt, in its proper colours; of which I
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60829:106"/> met with ſome inſtances my ſelf, and could not but ſmile to ſee ſome of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Faction ſo far to forget their Courts of Inquiſition as to argue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Converſions by the <hi>Dragoons,</hi> as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the <hi>Catholick</hi> Religion. Yet the Pope was of another mind, for the Duke <hi>d'Eſtrées</hi> gave him an account of the Kings proceedings in this matter very copiouſly, as he himſelf related it. Upon which the Pope approved all, and expreſſed a great ſatisfaction in every thing that the King had done in that matter; and the Pope added, that he found ſome Cardinals [as I remember the Duke <hi>d'Eſtrées</hi> ſaid two] were not pleaſed with it, and had taken the liberty to cenſure it, but the Pope ſaid, they were to blame: The Duke <hi>d'Eſtrees</hi> did not name the two Cardinals, though he ſaid he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved he knew who they were: and it is very likely that Cardinal <hi>Pio</hi> was one, for I was told that he ſpoke freely enough of this matter. I muſt take the liberty to add one thing to you, that I do not ſee that Great Monarch is to be ſo much blamed in this matter as his Religion is, which, without queſtion, obligeth him to extirpate Hereticks, and not to keep his faith to them: ſo that inſtead of cenſuring him, I muſt only lament his being bred up in a Religion that doth certainly oblige him to deveſt himſelf of humanity, and to violate his faith, whenſoever the cauſe of his Church and Religion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth it: Or if there is any thing in this conduct that cannot be entirely juſtified from the principles of that Religion, it is this, that he doth not put the Hereticks to death out of hand, but that he forceth them, by all the extremities poſſible, to ſign an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration, that all the World muſt needs ſee is done againſt their Conſciences: and this being the only end of their miſeries, thoſe that would think any ſort of death a happy concluſion of their ſufferings, ſeeing no proſpect of ſuch a glorious iſſue out of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60829:106"/> their troubles, are prevailed on by the many lingring deaths of which they ſee no end, to make Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack of their faith: This appearance of mercy in not putting men to death, doth truly verifie the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter that <hi>Solomon</hi> giveth of the tender mercies of the wicked, that they are cruel.</p>
               <p>But I will ſtop here, though it is not eaſie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire from ſo copious a ſubject, that as it affordeth ſo much matter, ſo upon many accounts raiſeth a heat of thought that is not eaſily governed. I will now lead you to a Scene that giveth leſs paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>I paſt the Winter at <hi>Geneva,</hi> with more ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that I had thought it was poſſible for me to have found any where out of <hi>England:</hi> though that received great allaies from the moſt lamentable Stories that we had every day from <hi>France:</hi> but there is a ſorrow by which the heart is made bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I ought to make the moſt publick acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments poſſible for the Extraordinary Civilities that I met with in any one particular: but that is too low a Subject to entertain you with it. That which pleaſed me moſt, was of a more publick na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, before I left <hi>Geneva,</hi> the numbers of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> there was ſuch, that I found we could make a ſmall Congregation. For we were Twelve or Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, ſo I addreſſed my ſelf to the Councel of Twenty five for liberty, to have our own worſhip in our own Language, according to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy. This was immediately granted in ſo obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging a manner, that as there was not one perſon that made any exception to it, ſo they ſent one of their body to me, to let me know that in caſe our number ſhould grow to be ſo great, that it were fit for us to aſſemble in a Church, they would grant us one, which had been done in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> reign: but till then we might hold our aſſemblies as we thought fit. So after that time, during the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60829:107"/> reſt of my ſtay there, we had every Sunday our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions according to the Common Prayer, Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Evening: and at the Evening Prayer, I preacht in a Room that was indeed too large for our ſmall Company, but there being a conſiderable number in <hi>Geneva</hi> that Underſtand <hi>Engliſh</hi> and in particular ſome of the Profeſſors and Miniſters, we had a great many ſtrangers that met with us: and the laſt Sunday I gave the Sacrament according to the way of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and upon this occaſion I found a general joy in the Town, for this that I had given them an opportunity of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the reſpect they had for our Church, and as in their publick Prayers they always prayed for the Churches of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> as well as for the King, ſo in private diſcourſe they ſhewed all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eſteem for our Conſtitutions, and they ſpoke of the unhappy diviſions among us, and of the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that was made from us, upon the account of our Government and Ceremonies with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret and diſlike. I ſhall name to you only two of their Profeſſours, that as they are Men of great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, ſo they were the Perſons with whom I converſed the moſt. The one is Mr. <hi>Turretin,</hi> a Man of great Learning, that by his Indefatigable Study and Labour has much worn out and waſted his ſtrength; amidſt all the affluence of a great plenty of Fortune to which he was born, one diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns in him all the modeſty of a humble and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified temper, and of an active and fervent charity, proportioned to his abundance or rather beyond it; and there is in him ſuch a melting zeal for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as the preſent conjuncture calls for, with all the ſeriouſneſs of piety and devotion, which ſhews it ſelf both in private converſation and in his moſt edifying Sermons by which he enters deep into the conſciences of his Hearers. The other is Mr. <hi>Tron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin,</hi> a Man of a ſtrong head, and of a clear and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60829:107"/> correct Judgment; who has all his thoughts well digeſted; his converſation has an engaging charm in it that cannot be reſiſted. He is a Man of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary virtue and of a readineſs to oblige and ſerve all Perſons, that has ſcarce any meaſures. His Sermons have a ſublimity in them that ſtrikes the hearer as well as it edifies him. His thoughts are noble, and his Eloquence is Maſculine and exact, and has all the Majeſty of the Chair in it, temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all the ſoftneſs of perſuaſion, ſo that he not only convinces his Hearers, but ſubdues them and triumphs over them. In ſuch Company it was no wonder if time ſeemed to go off too faſt, ſo that I left <hi>Geneva</hi> with a concern, that I ſhould not have felt in leaving any place out of the Iſle of <hi>Brittain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From <hi>Geneva,</hi> I went a ſecond time through <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland</hi> to <hi>Baſile:</hi> At <hi>Avanche</hi> I ſaw the Noble frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a great <hi>Roman</hi> Work, which ſeems to have been the <hi>Portico</hi> to ſome Temple: the heads of the Pillars are about four foot ſquare of the <hi>Jonick</hi> Order: The Temple hath been dedicated to <hi>Neptune</hi> or ſome Sea god; for on the fragments of the <hi>Architrave,</hi> which are very beautiful, there are <hi>Dolphins</hi> and <hi>Sea-horſes</hi> in <hi>bas-reliefs;</hi> and the neighbourhood of the place to the Lakes of <hi>Iverdun</hi> and <hi>Morat</hi> maketh this more evident: there is alſo a Pillar ſtanding up in its full height, or rather the corner of a building, in which one ſeeth the reſts of a regular Architecture in two ranks of Pillars: If the ground near this were carefully ſearch'd, no doubt it would diſcover more reſts of that Fabrick. Not far from this is <hi>Morat;</hi> and a little on this ſide of it is a Chappel, full of the bones of the <hi>Burgundians</hi> that were killed by the <hi>Switzers,</hi> when this place was beſieged by the famous <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> who loſt a great Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, that was entirely cut off by the beſieged; the inſcription is very extraordinary, eſpecially for that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60829:108"/> Age: for the bones being ſo piled up that the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is quite filled with them: the inſcription bears, that <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi>'s Army having beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Morat, Hoc ſui Monumentum reliquit,</hi> had left that Monument behind it. It cannot but ſeem ſtrange to one that views <hi>Morat,</hi> to imagine how it was poſſible for a Town ſo ſituated, and ſo ſlightly fortified, to hold out againſt ſo powerful a Prince and ſo great an Army that brought Cannon before it. I met with nothing remarkable between this and <hi>Baſile,</hi> except that I ſtaid ſometime at <hi>Bern,</hi> and knew it better; and at this ſecond time it was, that my Lord <hi>Advoyer d'Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lach</hi> gave order to ſhew me the Original Records of the famous Proceſs of the four <hi>Dominicans;</hi> upon which I have retoucht the Letter that I writ to you laſt year, ſo that I now ſend it to you with the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections and enlargements, that this ſecond ſtay at <hi>Bern</hi> gave me occaſion to make.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Baſile</hi> is the Town of the greateſt extent of all <hi>Switzerland,</hi> but it is not inhabited in proportion to its extent. The <hi>Rhine</hi> maketh a crook before it: and the Town is ſituated on a riſing ground, which hath a noble effect on the eye, when one is on the Bridge, for it looketh like a Theater. Little <hi>Baſile</hi> on the other ſide of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> is almoſt a fourth part of the whole: The Town is ſurrounded with a Wall and Ditch, but it is ſo expoſed on ſo many ſides, and hath now ſo dreadful a Neighbour within a quarter of a League of it, the Fort of <hi>Huningh,</hi> that it hath nothing to truſt to, humanly ſpeaking, but its Union with the other Cantons. The maxims of this Canton have hindred its being better peopled than it is, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of the Burgerſhip are ſuch, that the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens will not ſhare them with ſtrangers; and by this means they do not admit them. For I was told, that during the laſt War, that <hi>Alſatia</hi> was ſo often the ſeat of both Armies, <hi>Baſile</hi> having then a neutrality, it might have been well filled, if it had not been for
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60829:108"/> this maxim. And it were a great happineſs to all the Cantons, if they could have different degrees of Burgerſhip, ſo that the lower degrees might be given to ſtrangers for their encouragement to come and live among them: and the higher degrees which qualifie men for the advantagious Employments of the State, might be reſerved for the ancient Families of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. <hi>Baſile</hi> is divided into ſixteen Companies, and every one of theſe hath four Members in the little Council, ſo that it conſiſteth of ſixty four: But of thoſe four, two are choſen by the Company it ſelf, who are called the Maſters, and the other two are choſen by the Councel out of the Company; and thus as there are two ſorts of Councellers, choſen in thoſe different manners, there are alſo two chief Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates. There are two Burghermaſters that Reign by turns, and two <hi>Zunſt-Maſters</hi> that have alſo their turns, and all is for life: And the laſt are the heads of the Companies, like the <hi>Roman Tribunes</hi> of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The Fabrick of the Stadt-Houſe is ancient; there is very good Painting <hi>in freſco</hi> upon the Walls; one Piece hath given much offence to the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> though they have no reaſon to blame the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for it; ſince it was done ſeveral years before it, in the year 1510. It is a repreſentation of the Day of Judgement, and after Sentence given, the Devil is repreſented driving many before him to Hell, and among theſe there is ſeveral Eccleſiaſticks. But it is believed that the Councel which ſate ſo long in this place, acting ſo vigorouſly againſt the Pope, ingaged the Town into ſuch a hatred of the Papacy, that this might give the riſe to this repreſentation. The more learned in the Town aſcribe the beginning of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom in <hi>Baſile</hi> of the Clocks anticipating the time a full Hour, to the ſitting of the Councel, and they ſay that in order to the advancing of buſineſs, and the ſhortning their Seſſions, they ordered their Clocks to be ſet forward an Hour, which continueth to this
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60829:109"/> day. The Cathedral is a great old <hi>Gothick</hi> building; the Chamber where the Councel ſate, is of no great reception, and is a very ordinary Room: <hi>Eraſmus</hi>'s Tomb is only a plain Inſcription upon a great braſs plate: There are many of <hi>Holbens</hi>'s Pictures, who was a Native of <hi>Baſile,</hi> and was recommended by <hi>Eraſmus</hi> to King <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. the two beſt are a <hi>Corpo</hi> or <hi>Chriſt</hi> dead, which is certainly one of the beſt in the World: There is another Piece of his in the Stadt-Houſe, for this is in the publick Library, of about three or four foot ſquare; in which, in ſix ſeveral Cantons, the ſeveral parts of our Saviours Paſſion are repreſented with a life and beauty that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be enough admired; it is valued at ten thouſand Crowns; it is in Wood, but hath that freſhneſs of Colour on it, that ſeems peculiar to <hi>Holbens</hi>'s Pencil. There is alſo a Dance that he painted on the Walls of an Houſe where he uſed to drink, that is ſo worn out that very little is now to be ſeen, except ſhapes and poſtures: but theſe ſhew the exquiſiteneſs of the hand. There is another longer Dance that runneth all along the ſide of the Convent of the <hi>Auguſtinians.</hi> which is now the <hi>French</hi> Church, which is Deaths Dance; there are above threeſcore figures in it at full length of Perſons of all ranks, from Popes, Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and Kings, down to the meaneſt ſorts of People, and of all Ages and Profeſſions, to whom Death ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in an inſolent and ſurprizing poſture, and the ſeveral paſſions that they expreſs are ſo well ſet out, that this was certainly a great deſign. But the <hi>freſco</hi> being expoſed to the Air, this was ſo worn out ſome time ago, that they ordered the beſt Painter they had to lay new Colour on it, but this is ſo ill done that one had rather ſee the dead ſhadows of <hi>Holbens</hi>'s Pencil, than this courſe work. There is in <hi>Baſile</hi> a Gun-Smith that maketh Wind-Guns, and he ſhewed me one that as it received at once Air for ten ſhot, ſo it had this particular to it, which he pretends is his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60829:109"/> own Invention, that he can diſcharge all the Air that can be parcelled out in ten ſhot at once, to give a home blow. I confeſs thoſe are terrible inſtruments, and it ſeems the intereſt of Mankind to forbid them quite, ſince they can be imployed to aſſaſſinate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſo dextrouſly, that neither noiſe nor ſire will diſcover from what hand the ſhot cometh. The Library of <hi>Baſile</hi> is, by much the beſt in all <hi>Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> there is a fine collection of Medals in it, and a very handſome Library of Manuſcripts; the Room is Noble, and diſpoſed in a very good method. Their Manuſcripts are chiefly the <hi>Latine</hi> Fathers, or <hi>Latine</hi> Tranſlations of the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers, ſome good Bibles, they have the Goſpels in <hi>Greek</hi> Capitals, but they are vitiouſly writ in many places: There is an infinite number of the Writers of the darker Ages, and there are Legends and Sermons without number. All the Books that were in the ſeueral Monaſteries at the time of the Reformation were carefully preſerved; and they believe that the Biſhops who ſate here in the Council, brought with them a great many Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts which they never carried away. Among their Manuſcripts I ſaw four of <hi>Huſs</hi>'s Letters that he writ to the <hi>Bohemians</hi> the day before his death, which are very devout, but exceſſively ſimple. The Manuſcripts of this Library are far more numerous than thoſe of <hi>Bern,</hi> which were gathered by <hi>Bongarſius,</hi> and left by him to the publick Library there: They are indeed very little conſidered there, and are the worſt kept that ever I ſaw: But it is a Noble collection of all the ancient <hi>Latine</hi> Authors, they have ſome few of the beſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> times, writ in great Characters, and there are many that are ſeven or eight hundred years old.</p>
               <p>There is in <hi>Baſile</hi> one of the beſt collections of Medals that ever I ſaw in private hands; together with a Noble Library, in which there are Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts of good antiquity that belong to the Family
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60829:110"/> of <hi>Feſch,</hi> and that goeth from one Learned Man of the Family to another: For this Inheritance can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſs to a Man of Learning, and when the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily produceth none, then it is to go to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. In <hi>Baſile</hi> as the ſeveral Companies have been more or leſs ſtrict in admitting ſome to a Freedom in the Company, that have not been of the Trade, ſo they retain their priviledges to this day. For in ſuch Companies that have once received ſuch a number that have not been of the Trade as grew to be the majority, the Trade hath never been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to recover their intereſt. But ſome Companies have been more cautious, and have never admitted any but thoſe that were of the Trade, ſo that they retain their intereſt ſtill in Government. Of theſe the Butchers were named for one, ſo that there are always four Butchers in the Council: The great Council conſiſteth of Two Hundred and Forty, but they have no power left them, and they are only aſſembled upon ſome extraordinary occaſions, when the little Council thinketh fit to communicate any important matter to them. There are but ſix Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liages that belong to <hi>Bazile,</hi> which are not Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of great advantage; for the beſt of them doth afford to the Bailif only a Thouſand livres a year: They reckon that there are in <hi>Baſile</hi> Three Thouſand Men that can bear Arms, and that they could raiſe Four Thouſand more out of the Canton, ſo that the Town is almoſt the half of this State, and the whole maketh Thirty Pariſhes. There are Eighteen Profeſſors in this Univerſity; and there is a Spirit of a more free and generous Learning ſtirring there, then I ſaw in all thoſe parts. There is a great decency of habit in <hi>Bazile</hi> and the garb both of the Counſellers, Miniſters, and Profeſſors, their ſtiff Ruffs, and their long Beards, have an Air that is Auguſt: The appointments are but ſmall, for Counſellers, Miniſters and Profeſſors have but
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60829:110"/> a Hundred Crowns a piece: It is true many Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are Profeſſors ſo this mendeth the matter a little: But perhaps it would go better with the State of Learning there, if they had but half the number of Profeſſors, and if thoſe were a little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter incouraged. No, where is the rule of St. <hi>Paul</hi> [of Women having on their heads the badge of the authority under which they are brought, which by a phraſe that is not extraordinary, he calleth power] better obſerved than at <hi>Bazile;</hi> for all the Married Women go to Church with a coif on their heads, that is ſo folded, that as it cometh down ſo far as to cover their eyes, ſo another fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing covereth alſo their Mouth and Chin, ſo that nothing but the noſe appears, and then all turns backward in a folding that hangeth down to their midleg. This is always white, ſo that there is there ſuch a ſight of white heads in their Churches as cannot be found any where elſe: The unmarried Women wear hats turned up in the brims before and behind; and the brims of the ſides being about a foot broad, ſtand out far on both hands: This faſhion is alſo at <hi>Strasburg,</hi> and is worn there alſo by the Married Women.</p>
               <p>I mentioned formerly the conſtant danger to which this place is expoſed from the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of <hi>Huninghen;</hi> I was told that, at firſt, it was pretended that the <hi>French</hi> King intended to build only a ſmall Fort there, and it was believed that one of the Burgo-maſters of <hi>Bazile,</hi> who was thought not only the wiſeſt man of that Canton, but of all <hi>Switzerland,</hi> was gained to lay all Men aſleep, and to aſſure them that the ſuffering this Fort to be built ſo near them, was of no impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to them, but now they ſee too late their fatal error: For the place is great, and will hold a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of Three or Four Thouſand Men; it is a <hi>Pentagone,</hi> only the ſide to the <hi>Rhine</hi> is ſo large,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60829:111"/> that if it went round on that ſide, I believe it muſt have been a <hi>Hexagone;</hi> the Baſtions have all <hi>Oril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons,</hi> and in the middle of them there is a void ſpace, not filled up with earth, where there is a Magazine built ſo thick in the Vault that it is proof againſt Bombs; The Remparts are ſtrongly faced, there is a large Ditch, and before the Cortine, in the middle of the Ditch, there runs all along a Horn-work which is but Ten or Twelve foot high; and from the bottom of the Rampart, there goeth a Vault to this Horn-work, that is for conveying of Men for its defence; before this Horn-work there is a half Moon, with this that is peculiar to thoſe new Fortifications, that there is a Ditch that cuts the half Moon in an Angle, and maketh one half Moon within another: beyond that there is a Counter-Scarp about Twelve foot high above the Water, with a covered way, and a <hi>glacy</hi> deſigned, though not executed. There is alſo a great Horn-work beſides all this, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uns out a huge way with its out-works towards <hi>Bazile;</hi> there is alſo a Bridge laid over the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and there being an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland in the River, where the Bridge is laid, there is a Horn-work that filleth and fortifieth it. The Buildings in this Fort are beautiful, and the Square can hold above Four Thouſand Men; the Works are not yet quite finiſhed, but when all is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated, this will be one of the ſtrongeſt places in <hi>Europe:</hi> There is a Cavalier on one or two of the Baſſions, and there are half Moons before the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, ſo that the <hi>Switzers</hi> ſee their danger now, when it is not eaſie to redreſs it. This place is ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated in a great Plain, ſo that it is commanded by no riſing ground on any ſide of it. I made a little Tower into <hi>Alſace,</hi> as far as <hi>Mountbelliard;</hi> the Soil is extream rich, but it hath been ſo long a Frontier Country; and is, by conſequence, ſo ill peopled, that it is in many places over-grown with Woods:
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60829:111"/> In one reſpect it is fit to be the ſeat of War, for it is full of Iron-works, which bring a great deal of Money into the Country. I ſaw nothing pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar in the Iron-works there (except that the ſides of the great Bellows were not of Leather but of Wood, which ſaves much Money) ſo I will not ſtand to deſcribe them. The River of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> all from <hi>Bazile</hi> to <hi>Spire,</hi> is ſo low, and is on both ſides ſo covered with woods, that one that cometh down in a Boat hath no ſight of the Country: The River runneth ſometimes with ſuch a force, that nothing but ſuch Woods could preſerve its Banks, and even theſe are not able to ſave them quite, for the Trees are often waſhed away by the very Roots, ſo that in many places thoſe Trees lye along in the Channel of the River: It hath been alſo thought a ſort of a Fortification to both ſides of the River, to have it thus faced with Woods, which maketh the paſſing of Men dangerous, when they muſt march for ſometime after their paſſage through a <hi>defilé.</hi> The firſt night from <hi>Bazile</hi> we came to <hi>Briſac,</hi> which is a poor and miſerable Town, but it is a noble Fortification, and hath on the <hi>Weſt-ſide</hi> of the River, over which a Bridge is laid, a regular Fort of Four or Five Baſtions. The Town of <hi>Briſac</hi> riſeth all on a Hill which is a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heigth; there were near it two Hills, the one is taken within the Fortification, and the other is ſo well levelled with the ground, that one cannot ſo much as find out where it was; All the ground about for many miles is plain, ſo that from the Hill, as from a Cavalier, one can ſee exactly well, eſpecially with the help of a Proſpect, all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of an Enemy in caſe of a Siege: The Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is of a huge compaſs, above a <hi>French</hi> league, indeed almoſt a <hi>German</hi> league; the Baſtions are quite filled with Earth, they are faced with brick, and have a huge broad Ditch full of Water around
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60829:112"/> them, the Counterſcarp, the covered way, which hath a paliſade within the <hi>Parapet,</hi> and the <hi>Glacy,</hi> are all well exec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ted; there is a half Moon before every Cortine: the Baſtions have no <hi>Orillons</hi> except one or two, and the Cortines are ſo diſpoſed that a good part of them defendeth the Baſtion. The Garriſon of this place in time of War muſt needs be Eight or Ten Thouſand Men; there hath not been much done of late to this place only the Ditch is ſo adjuſted that it is all defended by the flanks of the Baſtions. But the nobleſt place on the <hi>Rhine</hi> is <hi>Strasburg:</hi> It is a Town of a huge extent, and hath a double Wall and Ditch all round it; the inner Wall is old and of no ſtrength, nor is the outward Wall very good, it hath a <hi>Fauſſebraye,</hi> and is faced with Brick Twelve or Fifteen Foot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Ditch: the Counterſcarp is in an ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſo that the Town was not in caſe to make any long reſiſtance; but it is now ſtrongly fortified. There is a Cittadel built on that ſide that goeth towards the <hi>Rhine,</hi> that is much ſuch a Fort as that of <hi>Huningh,</hi> and on the ſide of the Cittadel towards the Bridge, there is a great Horn-work that runs out a great way with out-works belonging to it; there are alſo ſmall Forts at the two chief Gates that lead to <hi>Alſace;</hi> by which the City is ſo bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled that theſe can cut off all its communication with the Country about, in caſe of a revolt; the Bridge is alſo well Fortified; there are alſo Forts in ſome Iſlands in the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and ſome Redoubts: ſo that all round this place, there is one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Fortifications that is in <hi>Europe.</hi>

               <p>Hitherto the Capitulation with relation to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion hath been well kept, and there is ſo ſmall a number of new Converts, and theſe are for the greateſt part ſo inconſiderable, they not being in all above Two Hundred as I was told: The <hi>Lutherans</hi> for the greateſt part retain their animoſities almoſt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60829:112"/> to an equal degree both againſt <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts.</hi> I was in their Church, where if the Muſick of their Pſalms pleaſed me much, the irreverence in ſinging, it being free to keep on or put off the Hat, did appear very ſtrange to me: The Churches are full of Pictures, in which the chief paſſages of our Saviours life are repreſented; but there is no ſort of religious reſpect payed them, they bow when they name the Holy Ghoſt, as well as at the name of <hi>Jeſus;</hi> but they have not the Ceremonies that the <hi>Lutherans</hi> of <hi>Saxony</hi> uſe, which Mr. <hi>Bebel,</hi> their Profeſſor of Divinity, ſaid was a great happineſs, for a ſimilitude in outward rites might diſpoſe the ignorant People to change too eaſily. I found ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral good People both of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Miniſters and others, acknowledge that there was ſuch a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of morals ſpread over the whole City, that as they had juſtly drawn down on their heads the plague of the loſs of their liberty, ſo this ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving toucht them ſo little they had reaſon to look for ſeverer ſtrokes: One ſeeth, in the ruine of this City, what a miſchievous thing the popular pride of a free City is: they fancied they were able to defend themſelves, and ſo they refuſed to let an <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial</hi> Garriſon come within their Town; for if they had received only Five Hundred Men, as that ſmall number would not have been able to have oppreſt their Liberties, ſo it would have ſo ſecured the Town that the <hi>French</hi> could not have beſieged it, without making War on the Empire: but the Town thought this was a diminution of their Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and ſo choſe rather to pay a Garriſon of Three Thouſand Souldiers, which as it exhauſted their Revenue, and brought them under great Taxes, ſo it proved too weak for their defence when the <hi>French</hi> Army came before them. The Town be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to ſink in its Trade, notwithſtanding the great circulation of Money that the expence of the Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60829:113"/> hath brought to it; but when that is at an end, it will ſink more ſenſibly, for it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for a place of trade, that is to have always Light or Ten Thouſand Souldiers in it, to continue long in a Flouriſhing State. There was a great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nimoſity between two of the chief Families of the Town, <hi>Dietrick</hi> and <hi>Obrecht,</hi> the former was the Burgomaſter, and was once almoſt run down by a Faction that the other had raiſed againſt him; but he turned the tide, and got ſuch an advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Obrecht,</hi> who had writ ſomewhat againſt the conduct of their affairs, that he was condemned and Beheaded for writing Libels againſt the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. His Son is a Learned Man, and was Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor of the Civil Law; and he to have his turn of revenge againſt <hi>Dietrick,</hi> went to <hi>Paris</hi> laſt Summer, and that he might make his Court the better, changed his Religion. <hi>Dietrick</hi> had been always looked on as one of the chief of the <hi>French</hi> Faction, though he had been at firſt an <hi>Imperialiſt,</hi> ſo it was thought that he ſhould have been well rewarded; yet it was expected that to make himſelf capable of that, he ſhould have changed his Religion, but he was an antient Man, and would not purchaſe his Court at that rate: ſo without any reaſon given, and againſt the expreſs words of the Capitulation, he was confined to one of the midland Provinces of <hi>France,</hi> as I remember it was <hi>Limoſin;</hi> and thus he that hath been thought the chief cauſe of this Towns failing under the power of the <hi>French,</hi> is the firſt Man that hath felt the effects of it. The Library here is conſiderable, the Caſe is a great Room ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well contrived, for it is divided into Cloſets all over the body of the Room, which runs about theſe as a Gallery, and in theſe Cloſets all round there are the Books of the ſeveral Profeſſions lodged apart; there is one for Manuſcripts in which there are ſome of conſiderable Antiquity, I need ſay nothing
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60829:113"/> to you of the vaſt heighth, and the <hi>Gothick</hi> Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture of the Steeple and of the great Church, nor of the curious Clock where there is ſo vaſt a variety of motions, for theſe are well known. The <hi>bas reliefs</hi> upon the tops of the great Pillars of the Church are not ſo viſible, but they are ſurprizing; for this being a Fabrick of Three or Four Hundred Years old, it is very ſtrange to ſee ſuch repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as are there. There is a Proceſſion repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in which a Hog carrieth the Pot with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Water, and Aſſes and Hogs in Prieſtly Veſtments follow to make up the Proceſſion; there is alſo an Aſs ſtanding before an Altar, as if he were going to Conſecrate, and one carrieth a Caſe with Reliques, within which one feeth a Fox, and the trains of all that go in this Proceſſion, are carried up by Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kies. This ſeems to have been made in hatred of the Monks whom the Secular Clergy abhorred at that time, becauſe they had drawn the Wealth, and the following of the World after them, and they had expoſed the Secular Clergy ſo much for their ignorance, that it is probable after ſome Ages, the Monks falling under the ſame contempt, the Secular Clergy took their turn in expoſing them in ſo laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a repreſentation to the ſcorn of the World. There is alſo in the Pulpit a Nun cut in Wood, lying along, and a Frier lying near her with his Breviary open before him, and his hand under the Nuns habit, and the Nuns feet are ſhod with Iron Shoes. I confeſs I did not look for theſe things, for I had not heard of them; but my Noble Friend Mr. <hi>Ablancourt</hi> viewed them with great exactneſs, while he was the <hi>French</hi> Kings Reſident at <hi>Strasburg,</hi> in the company of one of the Magiſtrates that wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on him; and it is upon his credit, to which all that know his eminent ſincerity, know how much is due, that I give you this particular.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Strasburg</hi> we went down the <hi>Rhine</hi> to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipsburg,</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:60829:114"/> which lieth at a quarter of a miles diſtance from the River, it is but a ſmall place, the Baſtions are but little; there is a Ravelline before almoſt all the Cortines, and there lye ſuch Mariſhes all round it, that in theſe lieth the chief ſtrength of the place. The <hi>French</hi> had begun a great Crown-work on the ſide that lieth to the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and had caſt out a Horn-work beyond that; but by all that appears it ſeems they intended to continue that Crown work quite round the Town, and to make a ſecond Wall and Ditch all round it; which would have Enlarged the place vaſtly, and made a compaſs capable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to lodge above Ten Thouſand Men; and this would have been ſo terrible a Neighbour to the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate</hi> and all <hi>Franconia</hi> that it was a Maſter-piece in <hi>Charles Lewis,</hi> the late Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the Empire into this Siege. He ſaw well how much it concerned him to have it out of the hands of the <hi>French,</hi> ſo that he took great care to have the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi>'s Camp ſo well ſupplied with all things neceſſary during the Siege, that the Army lay not under the leaſt uneaſineſs all the while. From thence in three Hours time we came to <hi>Spire,</hi> which is ſo naked a Town that if it were attacked, it could not make the leaſt reſiſtance. The Town is neither great nor rich, and ſubſiſteth chiefly by the <hi>Imperial</hi> Chamber that ſitteth here, though there is a conſtant diſpute between the Town and the Chamber concerning Priviledges; for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Town, pretends that the Judges of the Chamber, as they are private Men, and out of the Court of Judicature, are ſubject to them; and ſo about a year ago they put one of the Judges in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; on the other hand the Judges pretend that their Perſons are ſacred. It was the conſideration of the Chamber that procured to the Town the neutrality that they injoyed all the laſt War. I thought to have ſeen the forms of this Court, and the way of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60829:114"/> laying up, and preſerving their Records, but the Court was not then ſitting. The Building, the Halls and Chambers of this Famous Court are mean beyond imagination, and look liker the Halls of ſome ſmall Company, then of ſo great a body; and I could not ſee the places where they lay up their Archives: The Government of the City is all <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran,</hi> but not only the Cathedral is in the hands of the Biſhop and Chapter, but there are likewiſe ſeveral Convents of both Sexes, and the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> have alſo a Colledge there. There is little remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the Cathedral, which is a huge building in the <hi>Gothick</hi> manner of the worſt ſort. The Tombs of many Emperours that lie buried there, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for their meanneſs; they being only great Flag-ſtones layed on ſome ſmall Stone balliſters of a foot and a half high: There are alſo the marks of a ridiculous Fable concerning St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> which is too fooliſh to be related, yet ſince they have taken ſuch pains to preſerve the remembrance of it, I ſhall venture to write it. There are from the Gate all along the <hi>Nef</hi> of the Church up to the Steps that go up to the Quire, Four round Plates of Braſs, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a foot Diameter, and at the diſtance of Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty foot one from another; laid in the pavement, on the firſt of theſe is ingraven: <hi>O Clemens;</hi> on the ſecond, <hi>O Pia;</hi> on the third, <hi>O Felix;</hi> and on the fourth, <hi>Maria:</hi> The laſt is about Thirty Foot diſtant from a Statue of the Virgins; ſo they ſay that St. <hi>Bernard</hi> came up the whole length of the Church at four ſteps, and that thoſe four plates were laid where he ſtept: and that at every ſtep he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the word that is engraven on the Plate, and when he came to the laſt, the Image of the Virgin anſwered him. <hi>Salve Bernarde:</hi> upon which he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>let a Woman keep ſilence in the Church,</hi> and that the <hi>Virgins</hi> Statue has kept ſilence ever ſince, this laſt part of the Story is certainly very credible.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60829:115"/> He was a man of Learning that ſhewed me this; and he repeated it ſo gravely to me, that I ſaw he either believed it, or at leaſt that he had a mind to make me believe it: and I asked him as gravely if that was firmly believed there, he told me that one had lately writ a Book to prove the truth of it, as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, it was a <hi>Jeſuit:</hi> he acknowledged it was not an Article of Faith, ſo I was ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>There is in the Cloiſter an old <hi>Gothick</hi> repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Saviours Agony in Stone, with a great many Figures of his Apoſtles, and the Company that came to ſeize him, that is not ill Sculpture, for the Age in which it was made, it being ſome Ages old. The <hi>Calviniſts</hi> have a Church in this Town, but their numbers are not conſiderable: I was told there were ſome ancient Manuſcripts in the Library, that belongeth to the Cathedral; but one of the Preben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries to whom I addreſſed my ſelf, being, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>German</hi> cuſtom, a man of greater quality than learning, told me he heard they had ſome anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Manuſcripts, but he knew nothing of it, and the Dean was abſent, ſo I could not ſee them, for he kept one of the keys. The lower Palatinate is certainly one of the ſweeteſt Countries of all <hi>Germany:</hi> It is a great Plain till one cometh to the Hills of <hi>Heidelberg:</hi> the Town is ill ſcituated, juſt in a bottom between two ranges of Hills, yet the Air is much commended: I need ſay nothing of the Caſtle, nor the prodigious Wine Cellar, in which, though there is but one cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Tun that is ſeventeen foot high, and twenty ſix foot long, and is built with a ſtrength liker that of the ribs of a ſhip, than the Staves of a Tun; yet there are many other Tuns of ſuch a prodigious big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that they would ſeem very extraordinary if this vaſt one did, not Eclipſe them. The late Prince <hi>Charles Lewis</hi> ſhewed his capacity in the peopling and and ſettling this State, that had been ſo entirely ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, being for many years the Seat of War, for in four
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60829:115"/> years time he brought it to a Flouriſhing condition: He raiſed the Taxes as high as was poſſible without diſpeopling his Country, and all mens Eſtates were valued, and they were taxed at five <hi>per cent</hi> of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of their Eſtates; but their Eſtates were not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued to the rigour, but with ſuch abatements as have been ordinary in <hi>England</hi> in the times of Subſidies; ſo that when the Son offered to bring the Taxes down to two <hi>per cent</hi> of the real value; the Subjects all deſired him rather to continue them as they were. There is no Prince in <hi>Germany</hi> that is more abſolute than the <hi>Elector Palatine,</hi> for he layeth on his Subjects what Taxes he pleaſeth, without being limited to any forms of Government. And here I ſaw that which I had always believed to be true, that the Subjects of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> are only bound to their particular Prince, for they ſwear Allegiance ſimply to the Elector, without any reſerve for the Emperor, and in their Prayers for him they name him their Soveraign. It is true the Prince is under ſome ties to the Emperor, but the Subjects are under none. And by this <hi>D. Fabritius,</hi> a learned and judicious Profeſſor there, explained thoſe words of <hi>Pareus</hi>'s Commentary on the <hi>Romans,</hi> which had reſpect only to the Princes of the Empire: and were quite miſunderſtood by thoſe who fancied that they favoured Rebellion; for there is no place in <hi>Europe</hi> where all rebellious Doctrine is more born down than there. I found a great ſpirit of modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with relation to thoſe ſmall controverſies that have occaſioned ſuch heat in the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Churches reigning in the Univerſity there, which is in a great meaſure owing to the prudence, learning, and the happy temper of mind of <hi>D. Fabritius,</hi> and <hi>D. Miek;</hi> who as they were long in <hi>England,</hi> ſo they have that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous largeneſs of Soul, which is the Noble Ornament of many of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Divines. Prince <hi>Charles Lewis</hi> ſaw that <hi>Manheim</hi> was marked out by Nature to be the moſt important place of all his Territory, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60829:116"/> ſcituated in the point where the <hi>Neckar</hi> falleth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Rhine:</hi> So that thoſe two Rivers defending it on two ſides, it was capable of a good Fortification: It is true the Air is not thought wholſome; and the Water is not good, yet he made a fine Town there, and a Noble Cittadel with a regular Fortification a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, and he deſigned a great Palace there, but he did not live to build it. He ſaw of what advantage Liberty of Conſcience was to the peopling of his Country, ſo as he ſuffered the <hi>Jews</hi> to come and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle there, he reſolved alſo not only to ſuffer the three Religions tolerated by the Laws of the Empire to be profeſſed there, but he built a Church for them all three, which he called the Church of the Concord, in which both <hi>Calviniſts, Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> had, in the order in which I have ſet down, the exerciſe of their Religion, and he maintained the peace of his Principality ſo entirely, that there was not the leaſt diſorder occaſioned by this tolleration: This, indeed, made him to be lookt on as a Prince that did not much conſider Religion himſelf: He had a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful application to all affairs, and was not only his own chief Miniſter, but he alone did the work of many.</p>
               <p>But I were Injuſt, if I ſhould not ſay ſomewhat to you of the Princely vertues and the Celebrated probity of the preſent Prince Elector upon whom that Dignity is devolved by the extinction of ſo many Princes that in this Age compoſed the moſt numerous Family of any of that rank in <hi>Europe.</hi> This Prince as he is in many reſpects an honour to the Religion that he profeſſes, ſo is in nothing more to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by thoſe who differ from him, than for his exact adhering to the promiſes he made his Subjects with relation to their Religion, in which he has not even in the ſmalleſt matters, broke in upon their eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht Laws, and though an Order of Men, that have turned the World upſide down, have great Credit
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60829:116"/> with him, yet it is hitherto viſible that they cannot carry it ſo far, as to make him do any thing contrary to the eſtabliſhed Religion; and to thoſe ſacred pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes that he made his Subjects. For he makes it appear to all the World that he does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider thoſe as ſo many words ſpoken at firſt to lay his people aſleep, which he may now explain and obſerve as he thinks fit; but as ſo many ties upon his Conſcience and Honour, which he will Religiouſly obſerve. And as in the other parts of his life he has ſet a Noble Pattern to all the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> ſo his exactneſs to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, is that which cannot be too much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended: of which this extraordinary Inſtance has been communicated to me ſince I am come into this Countrey. The Elector had a Proceſſion in his Court laſt <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> day, upon which one of the Miniſters of <hi>Heidelberg</hi> preacht a very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Sermon againſt Popery, and in particular, taxed that Proceſſion, perhaps, with greater plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs than diſcretion: This being brought to the Elector's ears, he ſent preſently an Order to the Eccleſiaſtical Senate to ſuſpend him. That Court is compoſed of ſome Secular Men, and ſome Churchmen, and as the Princes authority is dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated to them, ſo they have a ſort of an Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal juriſdiction over all the Clergy. This Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was a ſurpriſe to them as being a direct breach upon their Laws and the Liberty of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? ſo they ſent a Deputation to Court, to let the Elector know the reaſons that hindred them from obeying his Orders, which were heard with ſo much Juſtice and Gentleneſs, that their Prince inſtead of expreſſing any diſpleaſure againſt them, recalled the Order that he had ſent them. The way from <hi>Heidelberg</hi> to <hi>Frankfort,</hi> is, for the firſt twelve or fifteen miles, the beautifulleſt piece of ground that can be imagined; for we went
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60829:117"/> under a ridge of little Hills that are all covered with Vines, and from them, as far as the eye can go, there is a beautiful Plain of Corn-fields and Meadows, all ſweetly divided and incloſed with rows of Trees, ſo that I fancied I was in <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy</hi> again, but with this advantage, that here all was not of a piece, as it is in <hi>Lombardy:</hi> but the Hills as they made a pleaſant inequality in the proſpect, ſo they made the Air purer, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a pleaſant Wine: The way near <hi>Darmſtat,</hi> and all forwards to <hi>Frankfort,</hi> becometh more wild and more ſandy: There is a good Suburb on the <hi>South-ſide</hi> of the <hi>Main</hi> over againſt <hi>Frankfort,</hi> which hath a very conſiderable Fortification; there is a double Wall, and a double Ditch that goeth round it, and the outward Wall, as it is regularly fortified, ſo it is faced with Brick to a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heighth. The Town of <hi>Frankfort</hi> is of a great extent, and ſeemed to be but about a third part leſs then <hi>Strasburg:</hi> The three Religions are alſo to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated there; and though the number of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> is very inconſiderable, yet they have the great Church, which is a huge rude building; they have alſo ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Churches, and ſome Convents there. There are ſeveral open ſquares for Market places, and the Houſes about them look very well without. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their Archives they preſerve the Original of the <hi>Bulla Aurea,</hi> which is only a great Parchment writ in <hi>High Dutch,</hi> without any beauty anſwering to its Title: and ſince I could not have underſtood it, I was not at the pains of deſiring to ſee it, for that is not obtained without difficulty. The <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi> have here built a new Church, called St. <hi>Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin</hi>'s, in which there is as much painting as ever I ſaw in any <hi>Popiſh</hi> Church, and over the high Altar there is an huge carved Crucifix, as there are painted ones in other places of their Church. The Pulpit is extream fine of Marble of different colours very
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60829:117"/> well poliſhed and joyned. I was here at a Sermon where I underſtood nothing, but I liked one thing that I ſaw both at <hi>Strasburg</hi> and here, that at the end of Prayers, there was a conſiderable interval of ſilence left, before the concluſion, for all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples private devotions. In the Houſe of their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Diſcipline, they retain ſtill the old <hi>Roman Piſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> or Hand-mill, at which lewd Women are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to grind, that is, to drive about the Wheel that maketh the Milſtones go. There is a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Jews</hi> there, though their two Synagogues are very little, and by conſequence the numbers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great, they are very naſty. I was told they were in all above twelve hundred. The Women had the moſt of a tawdry Imbroidery of Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver about them that ever I ſaw, for they had all Mantles of Crape, and both about the top and the bottom, there was a border above a hand breadth of imbroidery. The Fortification of <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> is conſiderable, their Ditch is very broad, and very full of Water; all the Baſtions have a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-mine that runneth along by the brim of the Ditch; but the Counterſcarp is not faced with Brick as the Walls are, and ſo in many places it is in an ill condition; the covered Way and <hi>glacy</hi> are alſo in an ill caſe: The Town is rich, and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth a great Trade, and is very pleaſantly ſcituated. Not far from hence is <hi>Hockam</hi> that yieldeth the beſt Wine of thoſe parts. Since I took <hi>Frankfort</hi> in my way from <hi>Heidelberg</hi> to <hi>Mentz,</hi> I could not paſs by <hi>Worms,</hi> for which I was ſorry. I had a great mind to ſee that place where <hi>Luther</hi> made his firſt appearance before the Emperor, and the Diet, and in that ſolemn audience expreſſed an undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed zeal for that Glorious Cauſe in which God made him ſuch a bleſſed Inſtrument. I had another piece of Curioſity on me which will, perhaps, appear to you ſomewhat ridiculous. I had a mind to ſee a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60829:118"/> Picture that, as I was told, is over one of the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh</hi> Altars there, which one would think was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the Enemies of Tranſubſtantiation to make it appear ridiculous. There is a Windmill, and the Virgin throws <hi>Chriſt</hi> into the Hopper, and he comes out at the eye of the Milne all in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which ſome Prieſts take up to give the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. This is ſo courſe an Embleme, that one would think it too groſs even for <hi>Laplanders;</hi> but a Man that can ſwallow Tranſubſtantiation it ſelf, will digeſt this likewiſe. <hi>Mentz</hi> is very nobly ſcituated, on a riſing ground a little below the conjunction of the two Rivers, the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and the <hi>Main;</hi> it is of too great a compaſs, and too ill Peopled to be capable of a great defence: There is a Cittadel up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the higheſt part of the Hill that commandeth the Town; it is compaſſed about with a dry Ditch that is conſiderably deep. The Walls of the Town are faced with Brick and regularly forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but the Counterſcarp is not faced with Brick, ſo all is in a ſad condition; and the Fortification is weakeſt on that ſide where the Elector's Palace is. There is one ſide of a new Palace very nobly built in a regular Architecture, only the <hi>Germans</hi> do ſtill retain ſomewhat of the <hi>Gothick</hi> manner. It is of a great length, and the deſign is to build quite round the Court, and then it will be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry magnificent Palace, only the Stone is red; for all the Quarries that are upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> from <hi>Bazile</hi> down to <hi>Coblentz,</hi> are of red Stone, which doth not look beautiful. The Elector of <hi>Mentz</hi> is an abſolute Prince; his Subjects preſent Liſts of their Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates to him, but he is not tied to them, and may name whom he will: The Ancient Demeaſne of the Electorate is about Forty thouſand Crowns: But the Taxes riſe to about Three hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crowns; ſo that the Subjects here are as heavily taxed as in the <hi>Palatinate:</hi> There is
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60829:118"/> Twelve thouſand Crowns a year given the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor for his privy Purſe, and the State bears the reſt of his whole expence: It can Arm Ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men, and there is a Gariſon of Two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men in <hi>Mentz:</hi> This Elector hath three Councels, one as he is Chancellour of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, conſiſting of three Perſons; the other two are for the Policy and Juſtice of his Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. He and his Chapter have Months by turns for the Nomination of the Prebends. In the Month of <hi>January</hi> he names, if any dies, and they chuſe in the Room of ſuch as die in <hi>February,</hi> and ſo all the Year round. The Prebendaries or <hi>Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heer's</hi> have about Three thouſand Crowns a year a piece. When the Elector dieth, the Emperor ſendeth one to ſee the Election made, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendeth one, but the Canons may chuſe whom they pleaſe; and the preſent Elector was not of the Emperors recommendation. Beſides the Palace at <hi>Mentz,</hi> the Elector hath another near <hi>Frankfort,</hi> which is thought the beſt that is in thoſe parts of <hi>Germany:</hi> The Cathedral is a huge <hi>Gothick</hi> Building; there is a great <hi>Cupulo</hi> in the <hi>Weſt-end,</hi> and there the Quire ſingeth Maſs: I could not learn whether this was done only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the place here was of greater reception than at the <hi>Eaſt-end</hi> or if any burying place and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment obliged them to the <hi>Weſt-end.</hi> Near the Cathedral there is a huge Chapel of great Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and on the <hi>North</hi> Door there are two great Braſs Gates with a long Inſcription, which I had not time to write out, but I found it was in the Emperor <hi>Lotharius</hi>'s time. There are a vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Churches in this Town, but it is poor and ill inhabited. The <hi>Rhine</hi> here is almoſt half an <hi>Engliſh</hi> mile broad, and there is a Bridge of Boats laid over it. From <hi>Mentz</hi> all along to <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charach</hi> (which ſeems to carry its name <hi>(Bacchi
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60829:119"/> Ara)</hi> from ſome famous Altar that the <hi>Romans</hi> probably erected by reaſon of the good Wine that grows in the neighbourhood.) There is a great number of very conſiderable Villages on both ſides of the River: Here the Rats Tower is ſhewed, and the People of the Country do all firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the ſtory of the Rats eating up an Elector, and that though he Fled to this Iſland where he built a ſmall high Tower, they purſued him ſtill, and ſwimmed after him, and eat him up: And they told us that there were ſome of his Bones to be ſeen ſtill in the Tower. This extraordinary Death makes me call to mind a peculiar and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked for ſort of Death, that carried off a poor Labourer off the ground a few days before I left <hi>Geneva.</hi> The foot of one of his Cattel, as he was ploughing, went into a neſt of Waſps, upon which the whole ſwarm came out, and ſet upon him that held the Plough, and killed him in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little time; and his body was prodigiouſly ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the poyſon of ſo many Stings.</p>
               <p>But to return to the <hi>Rhine,</hi> all the way from <hi>Baccharach</hi> down to <hi>Coblents,</hi> there is on both ſides of the River hanging grounds, or little Hills, ſo laid as if many of them had been laid by Art, which produce the rich <hi>Rheniſh</hi> Wine: They are indeed as well expoſed to the Sun, and covered from Storms, as can be imagined; and the ground on thoſe Hills, which are in ſome places of a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able heighth, is ſo cultivated that there is not an inch loſt that is capable of improvement, and this bringeth ſo much wealth into the Country, that all along there is a great number of conſiderable Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. <hi>Coblentz</hi> is the ſtrongeſt place that I ſaw of all that belong to the Empire; the ſcituation is Noble, the <hi>Rhine</hi> running before it, and the <hi>Moſelle</hi> paſſing along the ſide of the Town; it is well fortified, the Ditch is large, the Counterſcarp is high, and the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60829:119"/> covered way is in a good condition; both Walls and Counterſcarp are faced with Brick, and there are Ravelines before the Cortines; but on the ſide of the <hi>Moſelle</hi> it is very ſlightly fortified, and there is no Fort at the end of the ſtone Bridge that is laid over the <hi>Moſelle,</hi> ſo that it lieth quite open on that ſide, which ſeemeth a ſtrange defect in a place of that conſequence: But though the Fortifications of this place are very conſiderable, yet its chief defence li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Fort of <hi>Hermanſtan,</hi> which is built on the top of a very high Hill, that lieth on the other ſide of the <hi>Rhine;</hi> and which commandeth this place ſo abſolutely, that he who is Maſter of <hi>Hermanſtan,</hi> is always Maſter of <hi>Coblentz.</hi> This belongeth to the Elector of <hi>Triers,</hi> whoſe Palace lieth on the <hi>Eaſt</hi>-ſide of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> juſt at the foot of the Hill of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſtan,</hi> and over againſt the point where the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle</hi> falleth into the <hi>Rhine,</hi> ſo that nothing can be more pleaſantly ſcituated; only the ground begins to riſe juſt at the back of the Houſe with ſo much ſteepneſs that there is not Room for Gardens or Walks. The Houſe maketh a great ſhew upon the River, but we were told that the Apartments with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were not anſwerable to the outſide. I ſay we were told for the <hi>German</hi> Princes keep ſuch forms, that, without a great deal of ado, one cannot come within their Courts, unleſs it be when they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad themſelves; ſo that we neither got within the Palace at <hi>Mentz,</hi> nor this of <hi>Hermanſtan.</hi> It is but a few Hours from this to <hi>Bonne,</hi> where the Elector of <hi>Collen</hi> keepeth his Court; the place hath a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Fortification, the Walls are faced with Brick; but though the Ditch, which is dry, is pretty broad, the Counterſcarp is in ſo ill a condition, that it is not able to make a great defence. This Elector is the Nobleſt born, and the beſt provided of all the <hi>German</hi> Clergy, for he is Brother to the great <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian</hi> Duke of <hi>Bavaria;</hi> and beſides <hi>Collen,</hi> he hath
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60829:120"/> 
                  <hi>Liege, Munſter,</hi> and <hi>Hidelſheim,</hi> which are all great Biſhopricks: He hath been alſo Six and Thirty years in the <hi>Electorate:</hi> His Palace is very mean, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but of one Court, the half of which is caſt into a little Garden, and the Wood-yard is in the very Court; the lower part of the Court was a ſtable; but he hath made an apartment here that is all fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Pictures: where, as there are ſome of the hands of the greateſt Maſters, ſo there are a great many foils to ſet theſe off, that are ſcarce good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for Signpoſts.</p>
               <p>The Elector has a great many gold meddals, which will give me occaſion to tell you one of the Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganteſt pieces of forgery that perhaps ever was; which happened to be found out at the laſt ſiege of <hi>Bonne:</hi> for while they were clearing the ground for planting a battery, they diſcovered a Vault in which there was an Iron Cheſt that was full of meddals of gold to the value of 100000 Crowns; and of which I was told the Elector bought to the value of 30000 Crowns. They are huge big, one weighed 800. Ducats, and the gold was of the fineneſs of Ducat gold; but though they bore the Impreſſions of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Meddals, or rather Medallions they were all Counterfeit; and the imitation was ſo courſely done that one muſt be extream Ignorant in Meddals to be deceived by them. Some few that ſeemed true were of the late <hi>Greek</hi> Emperours. Now it is very unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable what could induce a Man to make a forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry upon ſuch mettle, and in ſo vaſt a quantity, and then to bury all this under ground, eſpecially in an Age in which ſo much gold was ten times the value of what is at preſent for it is judged to have been done about Four or Five Hundred Years ago.</p>
               <p>The Prince went out a hunting while we were there, with a very handſome Guard of about Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore Horſe, well mounted; ſo we ſaw the Palace, but where not ſuffered to ſee the Apartment where
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60829:120"/> he lodged: There is a great Silver Caſolette gilt, all ſet with Emeralds and Rubies, that though they made a fine appearance, yet were a Compoſition of the Princes own making: His Officers alſo ſhewed us a Baſon and Ewer, which they ſaid were of Mercury fixed by the Prince himſelf; but they added that now for many Years he wrought no more in his Laboura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. I did not eaſily believe this, and as the weight of the Plate did not approach to that of Quick-Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſo the Medicinal Virtues of fixed Mercury, if there is any ſuch thing, are ſo extraordinary, that it ſeemed very ſtrange to ſee Twenty or Thirty Pound of it made up in two pieces of Plate. A quarter of a mile without the Town, the beſt Garden of thoſe parts of <hi>Germany</hi> is to be ſeen, in which there is a great variety of Water-works, and very many Noble Allies in the <hi>French</hi> manner, and the whole is of a very conſiderable extent; but as it hath no Statues of any value to adorn it, ſo the Houſe about which it lieth in, is in ruines: and it is ſtrange to ſee that ſo rich and ſo great a Prince, during ſo long a Regence, hath done ſo little to Enlarge or beautifie his Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. <hi>Bonne</hi> and <hi>Coblentz</hi> are both poor and ſmall Towns. <hi>Collen</hi> is three Hours diſtant from <hi>Bonne,</hi> it is of a prodigious extent, but ill built and worſe Peopled in the remote parts of it; and as the Walls are all in an ill caſe, ſo it is not poſſible to fortifie ſo vaſt a compaſs as this Town maketh, as it ought to be, without a charge that would eat out the whole Wealth of this little State. The <hi>Jews</hi> live in a little Suburb on the other ſide of the River, and may not come over without leave obtained, for which they pay conſiderably. There is no exerciſe of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> Religion ſuffered within the Town, but thoſe of the Religion are ſuffered to live there, and they have a Church at two miles diſtance. The Arſenal here, is ſuitable to the Fortifications, very mean, and ill furniſhed. The Quire of the great Church is as
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60829:121"/> high in the roof, as any Church I ever ſaw; but it ſeemeth the Wealth of this place could not finiſh the whole Fabrick, ſo as to anſwer the heighth of the Quire, for the Body of the Church is very low: Thoſe that are diſpoſed to believe Legends, have enough here to overſet even a good degree of credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, both in the ſtory of the three Kings, whoſe Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is viſited with great devotion, and ſtandeth at the Eaſt end of the great Quire; and in that more copious Fable of the Eleven Thouſand <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſulins,</hi> whoſe Church is all over full of rough Tombs, and of a vaſt number of Bones that are piled up in rows about the Walls of the Church: Theſe Fables are ſo firmly believed by the <hi>Papiſts</hi> there, that the leaſt ſign which one giveth of doubting of their truth, paſſeth for an infallible mark of an Heretick. The <hi>Jeſuites</hi> have a great and noble Colledge and Church here. And for <hi>Thauler</hi>'s ſake I went to the <hi>Dominicans</hi> Houſe and Church; which is alſo very great. One grows extreamly weary of walking over this great Town, and doth not find enough of entertainment in it: The preſent ſubject of their diſcourſe is alſo very melancholy: The late Rebellion that was there, is ſo generally known, that I need not ſay much concerning it. A report was ſet about the Town, by ſome Incendia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that the Magiſtrates did eat up the publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, and were like to ruine the City; I could not learn what ground there was for theſe reports, for it is not ordinary to ſee reports of that kind fly, through a body of Men, without ſome foundation: It is certain this came to be ſo generally believed, that there was a horrible diſorder occaſioned by it: The Magiſtrates were glad to ſave themſelves from the ſtorm, and abandoned the Town to the popular fury, ſome of them having been made ſacrifices to it; and this rage held long: But within this laſt year, after near two years diſorder, thoſe that were ſent by the Emperor and Diet to Judge the matter,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60829:121"/> having threatned to put the Town under the <hi>Imperial</hi> Bann, if it had ſtood longer out, were received; and have put the Magiſtrates again in the poſſeſſion of their Authority, and all the chief Incendiaries were clapt in Priſon: many have already ſuffered, and a great many more are ſtill in Priſon; they told us that ſome executions were to be made within a week when we were there. <hi>Duſſeldorp</hi> is the firſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Town below <hi>Collen,</hi> it is the Seat of the Duke of <hi>Juliers,</hi> who is Duke of <hi>Newburgh,</hi> eldeſt Son to the preſent <hi>Elector Palatine.</hi> The Palace is old and <hi>Gothick</hi> enough; but the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> have their a fine Colledge, and a noble Chappel, though there are manifeſt faults in the Architecture; the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is tolerated and they have a Church lately built here within theſe few years, that was procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the interceſſion of the Elector of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</hi> who obſerving exactly the liberty of Religion that was agreed to in <hi>Cleve,</hi> had reaſon to ſee the ſame as duly obſerved in his Neighborhood, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of his own Religion. The Fortification here is very ordinary, the Ramparts being faced but a few foot high with Brick. But <hi>Keiſerſwart,</hi> ſome hours lower on the ſame ſide, which belongeth to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of <hi>Collen,</hi> though it is a much worſe Town then <hi>Duſſeldorp,</hi> yet is much better fortified; it hath a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry broad Ditch, and a very regular Fortification; the Walls are conſiderably high, faced with Brick, and ſo is the Counterſcarp, which is alſo in a very good condition. The Fortification of <hi>Orſoy</hi> is now quite demoliſhed. <hi>Rhineberg</hi> continueth as it was, but the Fortification is very mean, only of Earth, ſo that it is not capable of making a great reſiſtance. And <hi>Weſel,</hi> though it is a very fine Town, yet is a very poor Fortification, nor can it ever be made good, except at a vaſt expence; for the ground all about it being ſandy, nothing can be made there that will be durable, unleſs the foundation go very deep, or that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60829:122"/> it be laid upon Piloty. In all theſe Towns one ſees another air of Wealth and Abundance than in much richer Countries that are exhauſted with taxes. <hi>Rees</hi> and <hi>Emmerick</hi> are good Towns, but the Fortifications are quite ruined. So that here is a rich and populous Country, that hath at preſent very little defence, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept what it hath from its ſcituation. <hi>Cleve</hi> is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious place, the ſcituation and proſpect are charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Air is very pure, and from thence we came hither in three hours.</p>
               <p>I will not ſay one word of the Country into which I am now come, for as I know that is needleſs to you on many accounts, ſo a Picture that I ſee here in the Stadthouſe, puts me in mind of the perfecteſt Book of its kind that is perhaps in being, For Sir <hi>William Temple,</hi> whoſe Picture hangeth here at the upper end of the Plenipotentiaries that negotiated the Famous Treaty of <hi>Nimmegen,</hi> hath indeed ſet a pattern to the World, which is done with ſuch life, that it may juſtly make others bluſh to copy after it, ſince it muſt be acknowledged, that if we had as perfect an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the other places, as he hath given us of one of the leaſt, but yet one of the Nobleſt parcels of the Univerſe, Travelling would become a needleſs thing, unleſs it were for diverſion; ſince one findeth no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſion for his curioſity in this Country, then what is fully ſatisfied by his rare performance. Yet I cannot give overwriting, without reflecting on the reſiſtance that this place made, when ſo many other places were ſo baſely delivered up, though one doth not ſee in the ruines of the Fortification here, how it could make ſo long a reſiſtance: yet it was that that ſtem'd the tide of a progreſs that made all the World ſtand amazed; and it gave a little time to the Dutch to recover themſelves out of the conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, into which ſo many blows, that came ſo thick one after another, had ſtruck them.</p>
               <p>But then the World ſaw a change, that though it
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60829:122"/> hath not had ſo much Incenſe given to it, as the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py conjuncture of another Prince hath drawn after it, with ſo much exceſs, that all the topicks of flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery ſeem exhauſted by it, yet will appear to poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity one of the moſt ſurprizing Scenes in Hiſtory, and that which may be well matched with the recovery of the <hi>Roman</hi> State after the Battel of <hi>Canne.</hi> When a young Prince, that had never before born Arms, or ſo much as ſeen a Campagne, who had little or no Council about him but that which was ſuggeſted from his own thoughts, and that had no extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary advantage, by his Education either for litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or affairs, was of a ſudden ſet at the head of a State and Army, that was ſunk with ſo many loſſes; and that ſaw the beſt half of its Soil torn from it; and the powerfulleſt Enemy in the World, ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Victorious Army that was commanded by the beſt Generals that the Age hath produced, come within ſight, and ſettle his Court in one of the beſt Towns, and had at the ſame time the greateſt force both by Sea and Land, that hath been known, united together for its deſtruction. When the Inhabitants were forced, that they might ſave themſelves from ſo formidable an Enemy, to let looſe that which on all other occaſions, is the moſt dreadful to them; and to drown ſo great a part of their Soil for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the reſt; and to complicate together all the miſeries that a Nation can dread, when to the general conſternation with which ſo diſmal a Scene poſſeſſed them, a diſtraction within doors ſeemed to threaten them with the laſt ſtrokes; and while their Army was ſo ill diſciplined, that they durſt ſcarce promiſe themſelves any thing from ſuch feeble Troops, after a Peace at Land of almoſt Thirty Years continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and while their chief Ally, that was the moſt concerned in their preſervation, was, like a great paralitick body, liker to fall on thoſe that it pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſupport, and to cruſh them, then to give them
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60829:123"/> any conſiderable aſſiſtance: When I ſay a young Prince came at the head of all this, the very proſpect of which would have quite dampt an ordinary courage, he very quickly changed the Scene, he animated the Publick Councils with a generous vigour; he found them ſinking into a feebleneſs of hearkning to Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions for a peace, that were as little ſafe as they were honorable, but he diſpoſed them to reſolve on ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding all, rather than to ſubmit to ſuch Infamous terms. His credit alſo among the populace ſeemed to Inſpire them with a new life; they eaſily perſuaded themſelves that as one WILLIAM Prince of ORANGE had formed their State, ſo here another of the ſame name ſeemed marked out to recover and preſerve it. It was this Spirit of Courage which he derived from his own breaſt, and infuſed into the whole People, as well as into the Magiſtracy that preſerved this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Some thing there was in all this that was Divine. The Publick Councils were again ſetled, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were at quiet when they ſaw him veſted with a full authority for that time with Relation to peace and war, and concluded they were ſafe, becauſe they were in his hands. It ſoon appeared how faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully he purſued the Intereſt of his Country, and how little he regarded his own. He rejected all Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Peace that were hurtfull to his Country, without ſo much as conſidering the advantages that were offered to himſelf, (in which you know that I write upon ſure grounds.) He refuſed the offer of the Soveraign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y of its Chief City, that was made to him by a ſolemn Deputation, being ſatisfied with that Authority which had been ſo long maintained by his Anceſtors with ſo much glory, and being juſtly ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, how much the breaking in upon eſtabliſhed laws and liberties, is fatal even to thoſe that ſeem to get by it. He thus began his publick appearance on the ſtage, with all the diſadvantages that a Spirit aſpiring to true Glory could wiſh for; ſince it was Viſible that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60829:123"/> he had nothing to truſt to, but a good cauſe, a favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Providence, and his own Integrity and Courage; nor was ſucceſs wanting to ſuch Noble beginnings; for he in a ſhort time, with a Conduct and Spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond any thing that the World hath yet ſeen, reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered this State, out of ſo deſperate a diſtemper, took ſome places by main force, and obliged the Enemy to abandon all that they had acquired in ſo feeble a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. And if a raw Army had not always ſucceſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt more numerous and better trained Troops, and if the want of Magazins and Stores in their Alliés Country, which was the chief Scene of the War, made that he could not Poſt his Army, and wait for favourable circumſtances, ſo that he was ſometimes forced to run to action, with a haſt that his neceſſities impoſed upon him; yet the forcing of the beginnings of a Victory out of the hands of the greateſt General of the Age, the facing a great Monarch with an Army much inferior to his, when the other was too cautious to hazard an ingagement, and in ſhort the forming the <hi>Dutch</hi> Army to ſuch a pitch that it became viſibly Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to the <hi>French,</hi> that ſeemed to have been fed with Conqueſts; and the continuing the War, till the Prince that had ſacrificed the quiet of <hi>Europe</hi> to his GLORY, was glad to come and treat for a Peace in the Enemies Country, and in this very place, and to ſet all Engines on work to obtain that, by the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome, and the jealouſies of other Princes; all theſe are ſuch performances that poſterity will be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to rank them rather among the <hi>Idea</hi>'s of what an imaginary Hero could do, then with what could be really tranſacted in ſo ſhort a time, and in ſuch a manner. And in concluſion every place that belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to theſe States, and to their Neighbours along the <hi>Rhine,</hi> together with a great many in <hi>Flanders,</hi> being reſtored; theſe Provinces do now ſee themſelves under his happy Conduct, re-eſtabliſhed in their former peace and ſecurity. And though ſome ſcars of ſuch
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60829:124"/> deep wounds do ſtill remain, yet they find themſelves conſidered on all hands, as the Bulwark of <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> againſt the fears of a new Monarchy, and as the preſervers of the peace and liberty of <hi>Europe.</hi>

               <p>The ſame learned Perſon has ſince my firſt conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with him upon this ſubject, ſuggeſted to me two paſſages of <hi>Feſtus Pompeius,</hi> that ſeem to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine this whole matter; and that tell us by what names thoſe <hi>Catacombs</hi> were known in the <hi>Roman</hi> time, where abouts they were, and what ſort of Perſons were laid in them, we have alſo the deſignation by which the bearers were commonly known, and the time when they carried out the dead bodies; and it appears particularly by them that in the repoſitories of which that author makes mention, there was no care taken to preſerve the bodies that were laid in them from rotting. His words are. <hi>Puticulos anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſſimum genus ſepulturae appellatos, quod ibi in puteis ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelirenter homines: qualis fuerit locus quo nunc cadavera projici ſolent, extra portam Eſquilinam; quos quod ibi puteſcerent, inde prius appellatos exiſtimat puticulos Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Gallus, qui ait antiqui moris fuiſſe, ut patres fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias in locum publicum extra oppidum mancipia vilia pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jicerent, atque ita projecta, quod ibi ea puteſcerent, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men eſſe factum puticuli.</hi> The other paſſage runs thus. <hi>Veſpae &amp; Veſpillones dicuntur, qui funerandis corporibus officium gerunt, non à minutis illis volucribus, ſed quia veſpertino tempore eos efferunt, qui funebri pompa duci propter inopiam nequeunt.</hi> All this agrees ſo exactly to the thoughts that a general view of thoſe repoſitories give a Man, that it will not be hard to perſuade him that thoſe burying places that are now graced with the pompous title of Catacombs, are no other then the <hi>Puticoli</hi> mentioned by <hi>Feſtus Pompeius,</hi> where the meaneſt ſort of the <hi>Roman</hi> Slaves were laid, and

               <p>I have ſince my being in <hi>Naples</hi> inſtructed one that was going thither in this particular, and have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this account from him; that he had taken care to plumm the water at the furtheſt pillar of <hi>Caligula</hi>'s bridge on the <hi>Puzzolo</hi> ſide; and found it was ſeven fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom and a half deep; but he adds that the Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men aſſured him, that that on the other ſide before <hi>Baia</hi> the water was 26. fathom deep; but as he had not a plummet long enough to try that, ſo he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved a good deal ought to be abated; for the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termen had aſſured him that the water was ten fathom deep on the <hi>Puzzolo</hi> ſide, though upon tryal he found it was only ſeven and a half; and by this meaſure one may ſuppoſe that the water is 20. fathom deep on the other ſide; ſo that it is one of the moſt aſtoniſhing things that one can think of that pillars of brick could have been built in ſuch a depth of water.</p>
